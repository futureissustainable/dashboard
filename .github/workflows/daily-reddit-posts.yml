# BIOBUILDS Daily Reddit Post & Comment Generator — v4.0
# =============================================================================
#
# Architecture:
#   Runs every weekday (Mon-Fri) at 01:00 UTC.
#   Generates 1 Reddit post in English that must resonate across all 3
#   markets (DACH, Romania, international) simultaneously.
#   Includes 3 comment recommendations for existing Reddit threads.
#   Output is committed directly to main in the output/reddit/ folder.
#
# SETUP:
#   1. Run `claude setup-token` locally -> copy the token
#   2. Repo -> Settings -> Secrets -> Actions -> New repository secret:
#      Name:  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
#      Value: (paste token from step 1)
#   3. Place this file at: .github/workflows/daily-reddit-posts.yml
#   4. Merge to default branch (schedule only fires from default branch)
#   5. Test: Actions tab -> "Daily Reddit Posts" -> Run workflow
#
# SECURITY:
#   - Actions pinned to full 40-char commit SHAs
#   - Permissions: contents:write + id-token:write (no PR needed)
#   - OAuth token = high-value credential -> rotate every 60-90 days
#   - Trigger: schedule + workflow_dispatch only (no PR/fork triggers)

            ===============================================================
            THE CORE CHALLENGE
            ===============================================================

            You must write ONE Reddit post in ENGLISH that simultaneously
            serves BioBuilds' two primary markets and broader European
            audience:
            - DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) — primary market
            - Romania — young families (30-45), ~70% IT industry, rest
              entrepreneurs or higher-paying professions. NOT luxury.
            - International (rest of EU) — secondary reach

            The post must feel like a real person's experience or research
            that naturally covers data relevant to multiple European markets.
            A post about "comparing modular home manufacturers across Europe"
            or "my experience building a Passivhaus" naturally serves all
            audiences without feeling forced.

            HOW TO DO THIS:
            - Write as someone with a pan-European perspective (expat, researcher,
              investor comparing options across countries, someone who built
              in one country and is comparing to others)
            - Include data points from multiple markets naturally:
              * DACH angle: German prices (EUR 4,800/m2), KfW funding, Fertighaus context
              * Romania angle: manufacturing origin, EUR 1,676/m2, certification data
              * EU-wide: Passivhaus standards, energy prices, modular industry trends
            - The persona should have a reason to discuss multiple markets
            - Don't force all 3 markets in every paragraph; weave them naturally

            ===============================================================
            AVAILABLE TOOLS (use ONLY these)
            ===============================================================
            You have ONLY these tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep,
            WebSearch, WebFetch.

            Bash, curl, shell commands are NOT available.

            To search the internet: use WebSearch
            To fetch a specific URL: use WebFetch
            To find Reddit posts: use WebSearch with site:reddit.com queries

            ===============================================================
            PHASE 1 — READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS (mandatory, do not skip)
            ===============================================================

            1. Read CLAUDE.md — project rules and constraints
            2. Read docs/reddit/REDDIT_SOUL.md — complete persona, writing rules,
               and UNIFIED 9-SUB ROTATION POOL
            3. Read docs/reddit/REDDIT_REPORT_SEO.md — SEO strategy data
            4. Read docs/reddit/REDDIT_REPORT_AI.md — AI citation strategy
            5. Read docs/reddit/REDDIT_PLAYBOOK.md — master strategy,
               positioning, post templates, compliance rules, data anchors
            6. Read .agents/skills/seo-audit/references/ai-writing-detection.md
            7. Read .agents/skills/seo-audit/references/aeo-geo-patterns.md
            8. Read docs/company/biobuilds-company-overview.md

            ===============================================================
            PHASE 2 — CHECK EXISTING POSTS (avoid duplication + rotation)
            ===============================================================

            9. List all files in output/reddit/ directory
            10. Read the last 5 posts (if they exist) and extract:
                - The "subreddit:" field from each post's YAML frontmatter
                - What topics were already covered
                - What personas were used
                - What pillar each post targeted
            11. Build a BLOCKED LIST of subreddits used in the last 3 weeks
                — you CANNOT use any of these
            12. Make sure your post covers NEW ground

            ===============================================================
            PHASE 3 — RESEARCH (get real, current data across markets)
            ===============================================================

            13. Use WebSearch to find 3-5 current data points relevant to
                this week's pillar. Search for cross-market data:
                - European energy prices or housing cost comparisons
                - Passivhaus certification stats across countries
                - Modular construction trends EU-wide
                - KfW funding rates (DACH angle)
                - Romanian/Eastern European construction developments
            14. Cross-reference with data from the strategy reports
            15. Find real competitor data from multiple markets

            ===============================================================
            PHASE 4 — WRITE THE POST (English, all markets, 8+ data points)
            ===============================================================

            16. Pick a subreddit from the unified 9-sub pool in REDDIT_SOUL.md
                - Do NOT use any subreddit from the blocked list
            17. Create a persona with a natural reason to discuss multiple
                European markets (expat, researcher, investor, builder who
                sourced from Eastern Europe, etc.)
            18. Write the full Reddit post following ALL rules in REDDIT_SOUL.md:
                - Natural, human-sounding English writing
                - Include AT LEAST 8 specific data points with numbers
                - Include data from multiple markets woven naturally
                - BioBuilds as ONE option among several (or not at all)
                - Include honest pros and cons
                - End with TL;DR (include 3-5 numeric anchors)
                - NO AI writing tells
            19. Create a realistic image_idea in the frontmatter. This must be
                an ORIGINAL image concept you propose (NOT from the Creatives/
                catalog). Reddit posts need unique, context-appropriate visuals
                like infographics, comparison charts, maps, or photos that
                match the persona's story. Describe what the image should show,
                its style, and why it fits the post.
                NEVER use or reference files from the Creatives/ folder.
            20. Save to output/reddit/ as:
                ${{ steps.date.outputs.today }}_[slug].md

            ===============================================================
            PHASE 5 — COMMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (trust builder)
            ===============================================================

            21. Use WebSearch to find 3 EXISTING Reddit posts where a
                helpful, data-rich comment would fit naturally
            22. For each, write a recommended comment that:
                - Adds genuine value (data, experience, checklist)
                - Does NOT mention BioBuilds (pure value, trust first)
                - Includes at least 2 specific data points
            23. Append the 3 comment recommendations to the post file

            ===============================================================
            RULES (violations = failure)
            ===============================================================
            - NEVER use Bash, curl, or shell commands
            - NEVER run git commands
            - NEVER sound like an advertisement
            - NEVER write as a BioBuilds employee
            - NEVER use AI-detectable writing patterns
            - NEVER use images from the Creatives/ catalog (always propose original image ideas)
            - NEVER duplicate a topic or reuse a blocked subreddit
            - ALWAYS write in English
            - ALWAYS include data relevant to multiple markets
            - ALWAYS pick from the unified 9-sub pool in REDDIT_SOUL.md
            - ALWAYS include YAML frontmatter per REDDIT_SOUL.md
            - ALWAYS include at least 8 specific data points
            - ALWAYS include a TL;DR with 3-5 numeric anchors
            - ALWAYS include 3 comment recommendations with real Reddit URLs
