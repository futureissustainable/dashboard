- Hook too long — must be sharp, short, and instantly compelling (seen 2x)
- Heavy reliance on quotes instead of original engaging storytelling (seen 1x)
- Long lines and dense paragraphs; need shorter chunks with breaks (seen 2x)
- Dark, heavy-handed, or unrelated tone/subject matter (seen 1x)
- Low-impact topic that misrepresents the product (e.g. facade maintenance vs. passive house) (seen 1x)

### Recent notes
- 2026-02-19: denied (0/100) — Too low impact, wtf are we talking about? facade maintenance? This is a passive house, you are talking like you are selling roof shingles.
- 2026-02-18: denied (5/100) — too dark, and unrelated
- 2026-02-17: denied (30/100) — Hook too long and boring. Read our top performers past posts for reference of how's a post should be made
- 2026-02-16: denied (40/100) — Almost there, but you lean too much on quoting sources, instead of telling a better overall more engaging story. Also try to limit lenght of lines by introducing more breaks and breaking up paraagrphs into shorter chunks with breaks between, users nowadays dont read articles, they read posts.
- 2026-02-16: denied (10/100) — The hook could be written by any other housing company on the planet, you instantly lost me, super boring. Not reading further. Rest is too long anyway. Break paragraphing up more.
