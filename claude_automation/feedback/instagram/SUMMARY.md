### Recent notes
- 2026-02-16: denied (30/100) — It is such vague posting, what are you even saying? Sounds like you are trying to be deep instead of actually being emotionally impactful. Be a visionary not a shaman.
- 2026-02-16: denied (10/100) — Way too long, Hook is too loong for cut off, and rest of text is too long for anyone to care at all - for instagram.
