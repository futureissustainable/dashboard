All insulation looks equal 
— until 4:00 PM.

That's when the heat stored in conventional, high-carbon insulation starts to leak back indoors. The material's performance cracks under pressure, and you go from feeling comfortable to suffering in your own home.

It's a cycle that makes no sense: we burn fossil fuels to create insulation that heats the planet, only for it to fail during the very heatwaves it helped create. 

The data from our 35°C (95°F) field test shows the shocking difference:

The Feel Test
Polystyrene Walls: The interior hit a stuffy 29°C (82°F).
Straw Walls: The interior stayed at a cool 24°C (75°F).

The Heat Wave Test
Synthetics: Surrender their heat after just 6 hours.
Bio-Based: Absorb and hold heat for 12+ hours. 
The heat that gets through is 5 times weaker.

The Carbon Test
Foam/Fiberglass: EMITS ~200 kg of CO₂ per cubic meter.
Straw/Wood Fibre: STORES >200 kg of CO₂ per cubic meter.

Stop investing in materials that are a liability to your comfort and the planet. 
It's time to build with walls that actually work.

The Rich Will Buy Silence. 
The Wise Will Build It.

In a world addicted to noise, silence is becoming the new luxury.

And I'm not talking about silence as absence — I'm talking about silence as presence.

📍 The silence that lets you hear your own thoughts.
📍 The stillness that lowers your cortisol.
📍 The acoustic calm where children focus better.
📍 The deep peace that makes a house feel alive — not loud.

I still remember my first moment in a Passive House.

The silence was so loud, it made me pause.

It wasn't empty.
It was complete.

But here's the problem:
Most buildings today are designed for visuals. For square meters. For shiny surfaces.

Not for the nervous system.
Not for peace.

Acoustic design is the next wellness frontier.
And it's not about adding soundproofing.
It's about subtracting chaos — by design.

The rich will keep buying silence in remote retreats and gated spaces.

But the wise?
The wise will build it.
And their homes won't just be smart or efficient.
They'll be sacred.

What if we measured buildings not just in carbon...
…but in calm?

Tag a builder, architect, or parent who understands this.

## #3 — Zero Heating at -13°C

Zero Heating at -13°C: 
The Passive House as a Climate Change Solution

In our urgent battle against the climate crisis, transformative solutions are essential.

The RIA passive house exemplifies how we can live comfortably at -13°C without traditional heating, offering a potent weapon against the 29% of global emissions stemming from operational heating and cooling.

This journey with the RIA house began unexpectedly, with the breakdown of RIA's Stiebel Eltron LWZ 504 system, a ventilation unit with heat recovery and heating pump.

As winter was approaching and delivery times for these systems are typically long, we opted for a Nilan ventilation system without heating or cooling, focusing solely on heat recovery. 

The outcome was remarkable: RIA stayed warm even as temperatures plunged, defying the winter's harshness.

At the heart of RIA's success is its very accessible passive house design. It's an open design promoted by passivehouse.com, featuring superior insulation, airtight construction without thermal bridges, and the strategic use of solar heating. 

A specific feature of RIA is its south-facing solar glass front, acting as a thermal collector. During the day, it captures and stores heat, sometimes reaching an impressive 60°C, which is then released throughout the house at night. (It's also an amazing place for hot yoga too!)

This story is about more than just comfort in extreme conditions; it's a clear call for proactive climate action. Imagine the global impact if reducing domestic operational emissions, which are responsible for almost 29% of total emissions, through passive design became a priority. 

By embracing this transformative housing model, we can significantly reduce our collective climate footprint. The time has come for a bold paradigm shift in how we build and inhabit our homes.

## #4 — The Era of Toxic Efficiency Is Over.
**Reactions:** 116 | **Comments:** 33 | **Reposts:** 8 | **Age:** 5mo
**Image:** Thermal camera photo of wall

The Era of Toxic Efficiency Is Over.
Plastic foam failed. Polystyrene failed.

For 50 years, we wrapped our homes in plastic.

We chased "efficiency." Here's what we actually got:
Health Crisis: sealed petrochemical boxes. VOCs. Asthma.
Comfort Failure: 35 °C outside → 29 °C inside.
Climate Damage: +200 kg CO₂e/m³ emitted.

Today's most efficient homes are plastic-free.

Bio-based materials now lead: straw • wood fiber • hemp — bio-insulation that redefines performance.
No heating. No cooling. (Most days—by design.)
Prefab = speed + price control + accessibility.

New Benchmark: RIA House (straw prefab) 
Energy: 2 kWh/m²·yr (heating)
Airtightness: n50 = 0.10 h⁻¹ (~6× tighter than the Passivhaus limit)
Carbon: ≈ −200 vs +200 kg CO₂e/m³ (≈400 kg swing; bio vs foam)

Each home sequesters ~20–40 t CO₂e.
Health: low-toxin materials + balanced ventilation
Comfort: 24 °C inside at 35 °C outside (no AC)

We're at a turning point.

Challenge to the industry: 
Can any plastic-based prefab match speed, health, 2 kWh/m²·yr, and true comfort—without the carbon and end-of-life penalty? 

Stop plastic efficiency.
Build bio-based performance.

## #6 — Why We're Betting on Factories, Not Construction Sites
**Reactions:** 61 | **Comments:** 1 | **Reposts:** 4 | **Age:** 8mo
**Image:** Video — BIOBUILDS modular house being transported and mounted on site

Why We're Betting on Factories, 
Not Construction Sites

The construction industry is broken. 

Delays, waste, and buildings that harm our health and the planet.

So we flipped the script.

MODULAR by Biobuilds brings 95% of the building process into the factory.
Robotic precision. Passive House standards. Organic, carbon-storing materials.

A home that's built in 7 days and saves 340 tonnes of CO₂ in its lifetime.

We're now preparing our next factory expansion—targeting the U.S. and Canada.

To investors and ecosystem builders: if you're looking to back the Tesla of housing, we're building it.

Let's talk.

## #7 — We Don't Have a Housing Shortage. We Have a Waste Surplus.
**Reactions:** 57 | **Comments:** 7 | **Reposts:** 3 | **Age:** 8mo
**Image:** Photo/video — excavator in the middle of a waste/demolition site

We Don't Have a Housing Shortage. 
We Have a Waste Surplus.

Everyone's talking about the housing crisis.
Politicians. Economists. Developers.

But here's the real crisis:
11% of global CO₂ comes from construction materials.
35% of all landfill waste is building debris.
Entire cities are underused, while we keep building more.

We don't have a supply problem.
We have a waste problem.

A scale obsession problem.
A "bigger is better" lie that's aging badly.

Last month I walked through a 400 sqm villa.
Only three rooms were used.
The rest? Empty, echoing, and mortgaged.

We've built homes too big to sustain.
Too rigid to adapt.
Too empty to justify.

Meanwhile, the future is being lived in small homes:
💡 Lower energy footprint
💸 Less financial pressure
🌿 More freedom, not more furniture
⚒️ Adaptable, movable, regenerative

Minimalist living isn't a downgrade.
It's a return to intelligence.
It's not about owning more.
It's about owning smarter.

We don't need more buildings.
We need less burden — and way more brains.

## #8 — We Almost Became Another Katerra
**Reactions:** 55 | **Comments:** 1 | **Reposts:** 2 | **Age:** 7mo
**Image:** Video — showcasing multiple BIOBUILDS projects, from modular to RIA (world's most efficient prefab house)

We Almost Became Another Katerra—
Here's an Honest Story of Failure 
and a Meaningful Revival

The Dream:
It started with a personal vision: creating healthy, zero-energy homes.
RIA was born from this vision—one of the world's most energy-efficient Passive Houses, certified at just 2 kWh/sqm/year.
To scale this innovation, a specialized factory line dedicated exclusively to Straw Prefab homes was developed.

The Challenge:
Taking on every aspect from design to full project delivery—similar to Katerra's ambitious approach—proved overwhelming.
Managing numerous construction sites and subcontractors led to drained resources and significant project delays.

The Shift to MODULAR:
To address these challenges, MODULAR homes were developed—efficient, turnkey, and 98% factory-built.
MODULAR quickly gained popularity for simplicity and speed, unintentionally overshadowing the original straw-based approach.

A Surprising Demand:
Despite MODULAR's efficiency and success, architects and homeowners consistently requested Straw Homes.
They sought more than efficiency—they wanted homes with distinctive character, beauty, and genuine sustainability.

Reviving Straw Prefab:
Responding to this ongoing demand, STRAW PREFAB is being reintroduced as an open, collaborative platform.
Architect Flavia Ivanciuc passionately leads this revival, actively pursuing Passive House certification for the straw prefab construction system.

Why Straw Prefab 4.0 Leads in Sustainable Building:
Exceptional insulation with a U-value of 0.094 W/m²K.
Rapid construction, with semi-finished system assembled in just 5 days.
Carbon-negative design, storing up to 100 kg of carbon per square meter.

A Collaborative Mission:
True sustainability goes beyond technology—it thrives on collaboration and community.

By working together, architects, builders, homeowners, and innovators can create inspiring, planet-friendly homes.

## #9 — "So we can go on family trips instead of paying bills?"
**Reactions:** 50 | **Comments:** 3 | **Reposts:** 3 | **Age:** 8mo
**Image:** Video — Alin giving a lecture on passive homes to 15 children inside RIA

"So we can go on family trips instead of paying bills?" – A child, after touring RIA.

Today we welcomed a group of children to RIA. Curious minds, big questions.

We explained what a passive home really means:
🔋 Just 2 kWh/m²/year vs. 350 in a conventional home
🌱 Factory-built in days, breathing fresh air, built to last
💸 And how money saved on utilities… stays in the family.

One child said something I won't forget:
"So we can go on trips—with all the money we save?"

Another asked:
"Why don't you use concrete?"
And when they found out the house can move with you:
"It's like a snail house… but from the future." 🐌

None of them said they want a "big" house.
They said they want a clean house.
One where they breathe well.
One that lets them live—not just pay to survive.

Thank you to the incredible team at Școala Adventistă and to Maria Pahontu for organizing this visit and capturing these moments.

It reminded us:
The next generation already understands what we must now deliver.

## #10 — All breather membranes look equal
**Reactions:** 47 | **Comments:** 8 | **Reposts:** 1 | **Age:** 5mo
**Image:** Video — house wrapped in black membrane at sunset

All breather membranes look equal 
— in real life, one set the benchmark.

From smaller-scale tests, direct UV exposure, the pattern was always the same:

12 months → material started to lose quality
18 months → tapes and seals showed failures
24 months → UV degradation accelerated, surfaces became rigid and brittle

So we pushed the test further.
We built a full-size modular Passivhaus test house, south-oriented with large glazed areas, exposed on a hilltop.

The entire MODULAR envelope was made with Pro Clima SOLITEX FRONTA QUATTRO.

We left the membrane fully exposed for 2 years — no cladding.
Conditions: +38 °C summers, –15 °C winters

Deliberate stressors:
direct UV exposure
some nails and staples left uncovered
complex junctions at windows and frames

Why this matters
Most failures don't happen on flat surfaces.
They appear at intersections — frames, windows, fasteners.
This test included exactly those critical points.

Clear results after 2 years
Official rating: max. 6 months outdoor exposure

Observed performance after 2 years:
Still watertight and flexible → no signs of brittleness or cracking
sd-value ≈ 0.05 m → still vapour-open, keeps timber and insulation dry
Vapour permeance: 65 perms → high breathability maintained

Window and frame tapes intact
Staples area showed no premature aging
Tapes bonded so tightly they became almost inseparable from the membrane.

This is not marketing.
We have no agreement with any producer.
It's an ongoing durability test under real-world extreme exposure.
Because lab performance ≠ building performance.
👉 Next step: Year 3 review.

## #11 — 840 kWh vs. 15 kWh.
**Reactions:** 44 | **Comments:** 6 | **Reposts:** 0 | **Age:** 5mo
**Image:** Video — Arox Equipment office installation

840 kWh vs. 15 kWh. 
One is an energy bill. 
The other is a competitive advantage.

Most offices are liabilities disguised as assets. They drain energy from the grid and creativity from people. We've accepted this as the cost of doing business. It's not. It's the price of obsolete design.

This week, Arox Equipment SRL, under the leadership of Adrian Rob, made a strategic leap. They left behind a rented space consuming a massive 840 kWh/m²/yr for a MODULAR office engineered to consume just ~15 kWh/m²/yr. After their main hall was built in 8 months, we installed their new high-performance office—the company's beating heart—in just 2 days.

Here's the science behind the performance:
1. For the EMPLOYEES: A Neuro-Advantage by Design.
Constant Fresh Air. Studio-Grade Silence (54 dB). Total Thermal Comfort.

2. For the COMPANY: A Financial and Strategic Powerhouse.
A ~98% Reduction in Energy Costs. A Magnet for Elite Talent. Strategic Speed.

3. For the PLANET: A Carbon Bank.
This office saves ~340 tons of CO₂ over its lifetime compared to a standard building.
It actively stores ~40 tons of CO₂ within its structure, made of up to 98.6% organic, GRADE I materials.

What if your office stopped being a cost center and became your greatest asset?

You Can Buy a Bigger House.
Or a Better Life.

Most people still chase square meters.
Until they realize: more space = more responsibility.

I know, because I built one.
RIA — our family home.
A Passive-certified.
Just 2 kWh/m²/year.
Five bedrooms. Organic. Built with love… and purpose.

But here's the twist:
Most nights, I don't sleep there.

I sleep in a 19m² MODULAR with my wife.
No marble. No excess. Just calm.
And in that small space, I found something no villa ever gave me:
Freedom.

I own my space. It doesn't own me.

We call it Functional Minimalism.
It's not about shrinking.
It's about shifting.

Designing for:
🕯️ Stillness
💨 Clean air
🌱 Mindfulness
⚡️ Passive-certified living

The truth is: I built RIA because we have 5 children.
But as they've grown, I've seen a new story unfold:
➡️ Only 2–3 rooms are used.
➡️ The rest? Waiting for new purpose.
So we're transforming it — into a retreat.
A sanctuary for sustainability leaders.
Because homes should heal more than just families- they should heal the planet.

## #13 — The Future Is Not Just Electric. It's Organic.
**Reactions:** 35 | **Comments:** 1 | **Reposts:** 1 | **Age:** 8mo
**Image:** Photo — Tesla parked in front of a MODULAR by BIOBUILDS

The Future Is Not Just Electric.
It's Organic.

We've fallen in love with the electric revolution.

We put solar panels on our roofs and EVs in our garages. 
We feel smart. We feel clean.

And then we walk inside.

We walk into plastic-wrapped boxes built from the planet's most carbon-intensive materials. We meticulously charge our cars with clean energy, while passively breathing in a chemical soup of formaldehyde, VOCs, and microplastics from the very walls meant to protect us.

It's a massive, collective blind spot. We've upgraded the engine but we're driving a chassis made of rust.

The REAL revolution isn't just about clean energy. It's about clean environments.

It's about building homes that are carbon-negative, pulling tons of CO₂ out of the atmosphere and storing it in their walls for good.

It's about surrounding our families with 99% organic materials that create air so pure it can dramatically improve sleep, focus, and health.

It's about building sanctuaries, not just smart shelters.

The first wave of the green revolution was about electrifying our consumption. The next, more intelligent wave is about regenerating our living spaces. One was about gadgets. This one is about life itself.

So stop celebrating your solar panels if your house is still made of concrete. The job is only half done.

Tag a leader, developer, or architect who needs to build the other half of the future.

## #15 — The 'Entropy' Lie
**Reactions:** 33 | **Comments:** 5 | **Reposts:** 4 | **Age:** 7mo
**Image:** Photo — side by side of wood wall vs cement wall with CO2 emissions written above each

The 'Entropy' Lie: 
Twisting Physics Against Green Building 

Critics increasingly invoke thermodynamics—especially entropy—to undermine bio-based building methods. 

They focus narrowly on carbon debts from poorly managed timber, but conveniently omit key facts:

Embodied Carbon Reality:
A typical 200 m² concrete-and-steel home embodies around 70 tonnes of CO₂ upfront. 
By contrast, a bio-based home can store approximately 60–80 tonnes of CO₂.

Operational Carbon Truth:
Passive House design cuts heating/cooling emissions by 80–90%. 

Biogenic Superpower:
Europe annually wastes more than 40 million tonnes of surplus straw—enough to insulate 500,000 Passive Houses each year.
Every cubic meter of straw insulation stores ~129 kg CO₂.

The real obstacle isn't physics or entropy—it's legacy thinking and misleading arguments.

The Poor Will Inherit Bills.
The Wise Will Inherit Light.

In a world engineered for consumption,
dependence has become the norm.

We've normalized homes that can't function without the grid.
We've accepted monthly energy bills like taxes on life.

But what if we flipped the script?

I'm not talking about light as electricity.
I'm talking about light as freedom.

📍 The light that powers your home from your own roof.
📍 The design that captures sun, stores heat, and gives back.
📍 The daylight that wakes your nervous system gently.
📍 The glow that doesn't cost a thing — and never runs out.

The first time I heard about a house that didn't need a heating bill,
I thought it was an experiment.

But then I walked into one.
It wasn't off-grid survivalism.
It was elegance, intelligence, and stillness.

The poor will keep inheriting bills.
The wise will inherit light.

What if we measured buildings not in kilowatts…
…but in freedom?

For years, the middle class, accounting for over 42% of CO2 emissions and 40% of population, has faced an existential sustainability dilemma... 

How can we keep up with energy standards at an affordable cost?

Enter the world of affordable passive homes. In the US alone, interest in passive homes has surged by 200% over the last six years, with the number of passive house projects skyrocketing by 2200% in the last decade.

To bridge this gap we created Modular Shell (Beta): The Modular Shell is a fully standardized A++++ passive certified home. Over 28.7 times more cost-efficient compared to a standard home over its lifespan.

The Future of Housing Isn't for Sale.
It's Being Configured.

Legacy construction is collapsing.
Middlemen. Markups. Months of chaos.

Yesterday, a neighbor asked:
"Where can I buy a ventilation system for my new home?"
He'd spent €400,000 — and no one told him what he'd be breathing.

That's not tradition.
That's dysfunction.

Factory vs. Field Construction: 
How a Test Silenced the Skeptics

The Myth: Modular construction can't deliver passive-house performance
The Reality: 0.31 ACH50 with two assembled modules.

Context:
Industry average: 10–15 ACH50 (32–48× worse)
Passive House standard requires ≤ 0.6 ACH50
Our result: 48% better than Passive House required

Your home is a life-support system. 
Right now, it's either a healing chamber
or a plastic bag.

When indoor CO₂ passes 1,000 ppm, cognitive function can drop by 50%.

Two non-negotiable principles:
1. Radical Air Exchange
2. Best-Grade Filtration

Working with Zehnder to integrate MVHR and MERV-13/NOₓ filtration into our MODULAR platform.

## #30 — A Building Permit is a License to Pollute.
**Reactions:** 13 | **Comments:** 0 | **Reposts:** 1 | **Age:** 8mo

A Building Permit is a License to Pollute.

The construction industry is responsible for 39% of global CO₂ emissions. 
Yet, we issue permits as if that staggering fact doesn't apply.

Before you get a permit to build, you must present a Carbon Plan.

1. How much CO₂ will your building emit?
2. How much CO₂ will it store or save?

The net result is your "Carbon P&L."

You want to build? Show me your CO₂ plan.

AI Changes Everything. 
Is Your Home a Liability?

The world moves faster than ever. Jobs shift overnight.
But our homes stay rigid. They're old relics from a stable past.

AI can't move concrete. 
It can't make a rigid structure flexible. 
If we don't build adaptable homes today, we'll be trapped in static spaces tomorrow.

## #32 — Evaluating natural building materials

Evaluating natural building materials for short-term climate solutions.

Biobased materials like hemp, straw, and wood act as natural carbon sinks.

However, this carbon sequestration is temporary, as it's released once the buildings are demolished.

Should we acknowledge the transitional role of these biobased materials?

## #33 — 5 homes. Built in 15 days.
**Reactions:** 75 | **Comments:** 3 | **Reposts:** 5 | **Age:** 10mo
**Image:** Photo — 5 BIOBUILDS modular homes wrapped in white with "YOUR PASSIVE HOME IS HERE" written on each, assembled in a line (repost from BIOBUILDS page)

5 homes. Built in 15 days. At the strictest standards in the world.
The construction industry just ran out of excuses.

No wonder 82% of homeowners regret building the old way.
Wouldn't you?

Most people spend decades saving for a home—then lose years waiting for it to be finished. 

And when it's done? They're exhausted. And locked in to energy bills for decades.

-

Imagine skipping all of that.

Imagine choosing a home that's ready in days, not months. One that's built with precision at the highest building standards in the world, and tailored to how you actually live.

Quiet. Comfortable. Modern.
Built for the next 50 years of your life—not stuck in the last 30.

That is a BIOBUILDS home.
No delays. No budget spirals. No site-work.

Just a home that arrives complete, assembles in days, and saves you up to 90% on energy from day one.

-

Because your home shouldn't drain your time, your wallet, or your peace of mind. It should give all three back.

## #2 — This should be impossible. Unwrapping a turnkey house in 1 day
**Reactions:** 48 | **Comments:** 0 | **Reposts:** 1 | **Age:** 3mo
**Image:** Video — helicopter lifting white wrapping to reveal modular underneath

This should be impossible.
Unwrapping a turnkey house in 1 day seems unreal... 
But you're watching it happen.

While others spend 18 months managing contractors, permits, and stress.
This family spent 21 days.

10 days: precision prefabrication
2 days: delivery across Europe
3 days: unwrapped, assembled, move-in ready

No construction site. 
No delays. 
No compromises.

The construction industry has convinced you this level of certainty doesn't exist.
Because if you knew it did, you'd never wait again.

## #3 — The home of the future begins in a factory
**Reactions:** 46 | **Comments:** 0 | **Reposts:** 1 | **Age:** 4mo
**Image:** Photo — BIOBUILDS modular factory production line

The home of the future begins in a factory,
— not a construction site.

Think about the traditional construction process for a moment. The constant uncertainty. The "unexpected" costs. The feeling of your life being on hold for years at a time. It's a broken system that puts all the risk on you.

What if 99% of that stress just... vanished?

This photo isn't just a factory. It's the answer to that chaos:
- A commitment to a fixed budget with radical transparency.
- A commitment to a 3-week timeline from production to move-in, not years.
- A commitment to exceptional quality, meeting the strictest global norms (Passivhaus, EPD).

This innovative approach results in homes that transform lives. 

Imagine:
- Cutting your energy bills by up to 95%, 
- Enjoying cleaner air with 98% organic materials and active filtration,
- Reducing CO2 emissions by up to 337 tons. 

It's not just a home; it's a fundamental life upgrade.

The home of the future isn't about enduring construction; it's about embracing a healthier, sustainable, and financially sound life right from the start. 

It's time to build homes that work for us, not against us.
It's the epitome of zero stress. 🌳

**Image:** Video — entire BIOBUILDS modular house displayed at expo

Most construction companies showed up to this expo with roll up banners.
We rolled up with an entire house. 🏡

In a world obsessed with "modern," most builders are stuck in the 1800s—still slow, still wasteful.

It's time to move forward and build the future.
 So we placed it front and center.

People stopped. Some looked in shock.
 Then they walked in—and realized:
 This is how home should feel.

Why?
📍 Built in just 3 weeks, not 3 years.
📍 Uses 10x less energy, for life (certified at 15kWh/m²/year).
📍 Over 98% organic materials—a healthy home for a healthy family.

An architect told us,
 "I never thought something so modern could feel so natural."

This isn't just building faster or greener.
 It's building for the future—your family, your planet.

Most homes are built for looks.
 We build for living.

The truth? Modern energy-efficient design is all about maximizing comfort, space, and daylight.

Triple-glazed windows and smart shading fill your home with natural light year-round.

With modern passive design, you don't have to choose between efficiency and quality of life. You get both.

## KEY INSIGHTS

**Alin (Personal) vs BIOBUILDS (Company):**
- Alin's top post: 1,164 reactions. BIOBUILDS top post: 60 reactions.
- Alin's avg engagement is ~5-10x higher per post.
- Alin's thought-leadership dramatically outperforms BIOBUILDS product posts.

**What works (Alin — top 5 patterns):**
1. Data-driven comparison posts with specific test results (insulation = 1,164)
2. Philosophical/emotional hooks backed by substance (Silence = 190)
3. Honest vulnerability and failure stories (Katerra = 55, Daniel's bank = 26)
4. "X vs Y" framing with concrete numbers (Toxic Efficiency = 116, 840 vs 15 = 44)
5. Real human moments in the product (kids touring RIA = 50, Făgăraș = 66)

**What works (BIOBUILDS — top patterns):**
1. Timelapse/supercut videos with music (posts 12-14 at 25-26 each)
2. Bold "impossible" framing with visual proof (helicopter reveal = 48)
3. Factory/behind-the-scenes visuals (factory line = 46)
4. Confrontational comparison posts (traditional vs modular = 46)

**What doesn't work:**
- Generic "future of construction" posts without personal story or data surprise
- Repetitive speed/assembly messaging (diminishing returns)
- Recent BIOBUILDS posts (last 2 months) = literally 0 reactions — needs investigation
- Job postings, year recaps, duplicate posts

**Content gap:**
- BIOBUILDS company page lacks personal, philosophical voice that drives Alin's engagement
- Company posts repeat same value props (3 weeks, Passivhaus, 95%) without fresh angles
- No controversy, no vulnerability, no data surprises on company page

**Still pending images:** Alin #18-32 (15 posts) | BIOBUILDS #17-23 + zero-reaction table (21 posts)
