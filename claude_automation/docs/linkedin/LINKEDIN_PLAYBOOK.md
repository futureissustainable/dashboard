# BIOBUILDS LinkedIn Playbook
### The only document you need. No consultancy theater.

## 1. DIAGNOSIS

**Where you are:**

Alin's personal page: 33 posts. 87.2 avg reactions. Top post: 1,164. That insulation comparison post is proof of concept — the content CAN hit. But it hit once. The rest averages 30-50.

BIOBUILDS company page: 38 posts. ~25 avg reactions. Top post: 60. Last 2 months: flatline. Multiple posts with literally 0 reactions. The page is functionally dead.

**What's broken:**

Three things. In order of severity.

**Format mismatch.** You've never posted a single carousel. Carousels are the #1 engagement format on LinkedIn by a factor of 3-6x over text-only. Your best content (data comparisons, before/after reveals, technical breakdowns) is *built* for carousels. You're serving steak on a paper plate.

**Repetition fatigue.** "Built in 3 weeks." "95% less energy." "Passivhaus certified." "98% organic materials." These four phrases appear in nearly every post on both pages. Your audience learned this months ago. You're re-teaching a lesson nobody needs to hear again. It should be background context inside posts about something else, not the headline.

**Company page vs personal page misallocation.** LinkedIn's 2025 algorithm update crushed company page organic reach by ~50%. Personal profiles get 5-10x the distribution for identical content. Your numbers confirm this exactly (87 avg vs 25 avg). Yet you're still splitting effort 50/50 between both pages, and sometimes posting the same content to both — which triggers the recycled content penalty (84% less reach).

**Why it matters:**

You're competing for attention against every construction company, every sustainability startup, and every thought leader posting about green building on LinkedIn. The substance advantage is massive — Passivhaus certification, EPD carbon-negative, 200+ delivered homes, the RIA story, the origin story. Nobody else in your space has this ammunition. But substance without distribution is a tree falling in the forest.

## 2. PLATFORM CONTEXT — What LinkedIn rewards right now (Feb 2026)

LinkedIn deployed a new AI ranking model called **360Brew** in 2025. It replaced the old engagement-based feed with a relevance-based feed. Three signals matter now. Everything else is noise.

**Signal 1: Dwell time.** How long someone spends on your post. This is THE metric. A text post gets 15-30 seconds. A carousel gets 2-3 minutes (every slide swipe = engagement signal). A video that holds past 8 seconds gets boosted. The algorithm literally trains a model to predict how long each member will spend on each post, then ranks accordingly.

**Signal 2: Comment depth.** Not how many comments. How substantive they are, and whether commenters have relevant job titles. Five architects debating your claim about CLT is worth more than 200 people typing "Great post!" The algorithm measures reply chains. A comment that generates 3 replies is worth 10 standalone comments.

**Signal 3: Topical authority.** The algorithm now scores whether your account consistently posts about the same domain. If Alin posts about passive construction for 3 months straight, then drops a post about passive construction — it gets boosted. If he suddenly posts about AI productivity tips, it gets suppressed. Consistency in topic = higher base distribution.

**What's being killed:**

- Engagement bait ("Comment YES if you agree," "Tag someone who...") — detected by pattern matching, distribution throttled
- Engagement pods — detected with high accuracy, triggering shadowbans
- AI-generated content — 30% less reach, 55% lower engagement vs human-written
- Recycled content — 84% less reach for identical or near-identical reposts
- Hashtag stuffing — 3+ hashtags = 29% less reach
- Self-commenting (posting first comment on your own post) — now LIMITS reach, reversed from previous years
- Broetry (one-sentence-per-line emotional manipulation) — actively penalized

**What's being rewarded:**

- Carousels: 278% more engagement than video, 596% more than text-only
- Native vertical video under 90 seconds (usage up 69% YoY)
- Posts that generate saves (LinkedIn's new bookmark metric = strong signal)
- Content from accounts with high topical authority scores
- Posts that spark discussion among people with relevant professional backgrounds
- The golden hour: engagement in first 60-90 minutes determines ~70% of total reach

## 3. AUDIENCE SEGMENTS

You don't want 300K likes from random people. You want the right 10,000 eyeballs that either buy a house, invest in your company, or amplify your message to people who do.

**Segment 1: DACH (Primary market)**

Who: People building or planning to build homes in Germany, Austria, Switzerland. Don't over-specify demographics. They care about quality, energy performance, and whether the numbers make sense.

What makes them stop scrolling: Real energy bills from real homeowners. "€47/year heating" with a screenshot. Production quality that signals German-level precision. Client testimonials in German. The factory floor (Germans trust manufacturing process over marketing claims).

What they don't care about: Philosophical posts about silence and wisdom. Origin stories (they'll read this on the website once they're already interested). Hashtag-heavy LinkedIn influencer formatting.

LinkedIn language: German posts for organic DACH reach, English for broader distribution. Test both. Track which gets more profile visits from DACH.

**Segment 2: Romania (Primary market)**

Who: Young families, 30-45. Roughly 70% work in IT, the rest are entrepreneurs or in higher-paying professions. NOT luxury buyers. They've seen traditional Romanian construction fail (delays, cost overruns, poor insulation, corrupt contractors). They want out of that system.

What makes them stop scrolling: Horror stories about traditional construction that they recognize from personal experience. Speed comparisons. The "your neighbor started building 2 years ago and still isn't done" angle. Specific cost breakdowns in RON/EUR.

What they don't care about: Abstract sustainability arguments. Carbon sequestration numbers. Most Romanian buyers are driven by cost savings and lifestyle upgrade, not environmental ethics. Lead with savings, follow with planet.

**Segment 3: Tourism Entrepreneurs**

Who: People building or expanding glamping sites, boutique resorts, Airbnb portfolios. Romania, Austria, Southern Germany primarily. They think in ROI per unit, occupancy rates, and guest experience differentiation.

What makes them stop scrolling: "This cabin pays for itself in 14 months" with real booking data. Porumbacu Garden as a case study. The relocatability angle (ground screws = you can move the asset). Energy independence = off-grid capability = locations that were previously unbuildable.

What they don't care about: Anything that doesn't connect to revenue generation within the first two sentences.

**Segment 4: Architects & Building Professionals**

Who: Architects, engineers, sustainability consultants across the EU. They influence purchasing decisions. They specify materials and systems. Getting them to recommend BIOBUILDS to their clients is a multiplier.

What makes them stop scrolling: Technical depth. The membrane durability test. The airtightness numbers (0.24 ACH at 50 Pa — that's flex-worthy). The EPD data. Comparison tables between building systems. These people respect evidence, not emotion.

What they don't care about: "The future of living" type language. They've heard it from every prefab startup that went bankrupt. Show them the test results and shut up.

**Segment 5: Investors & Media (Secondary)**

Who: Impact investors, clean-tech VCs, construction-tech media, sustainability journalists. They're scanning LinkedIn for the next breakout company in the space.

What makes them stop scrolling: Traction signals. "5 homes built in 15 days." "Delivered to 3 countries." Client waitlist numbers. Revenue growth hints. The Katerra comparison (they all know that story). Factory automation roadmap.

What they don't care about: Product specs. They care about market size, defensibility, and growth trajectory.

---

**The targeting takeaway:** Every post should be written with ONE of these segments as the primary reader. Not all five. When you write a carousel about energy bill comparisons, you're writing for Segment 1 (DACH buyer) and Segment 2 (Romanian early adopter). When you write a technical deep-dive on airtightness, you're writing for Segment 4 (architects). When Alin tells the Katerra story, he's writing for Segment 5 (investors/media) with a secondary hit on Segment 4.

Tag the segment in your internal planning. If you can't name who the post is for, don't publish it.

## 4. VOICE & TONE — What to test, what to kill

### The BIOBUILDS Voice

**What it should sound like:** An engineer who reads Dostoevsky on the weekend. Precise but warm. Data-first but not cold. Says things that make you think, not things that make you nod.

**What it should NOT sound like:** A LinkedIn influencer who discovered construction. No "let that sink in." No "read that again." No aphoristic wisdom disconnected from evidence. No motivational speaker energy.

**The one rule:** Every philosophical or emotional claim must be within ONE sentence of a specific number, a named person, or a verifiable event. This is the line between authority and cringe.

### Before / After Rewrites

**❌ Before (current post #2):**
"In a world addicted to noise, silence is becoming the new luxury. And I'm not talking about silence as absence — I'm talking about silence as presence. 📍 The silence that lets you hear your own thoughts."

**✅ After:**
"I walked into RIA for the first time and the decibel meter read 28 dB. For reference, a library is 40. A whisper is 30. I stood there and realized I could hear my own heartbeat. That's what happens when you build walls with 336mm of wood fiber instead of concrete."

The difference: the first version is a LinkedIn influencer. The second version is a founder who built the thing.

**❌ Before (current post #16):**
"The Poor Will Inherit Bills. The Wise Will Inherit Light. In a world engineered for consumption, dependence has become the norm."

**✅ After:**
"Our neighbor spent €400,000 on his house. Nobody told him what he'd be breathing. His ventilation system? Doesn't have one. His energy bill last winter? €3,200. Ours? €47. Same street."

The difference: the first version sounds like a fortune cookie. The second version sounds like someone who has lived the comparison.

**❌ Before (company page post #3):**
"What if 99% of that stress just... vanished? This photo isn't just a factory. It's the answer to that chaos."

**✅ After:**
"This is our factory floor at 6 AM. In 21 days, the module in bay 3 will be a family's kitchen. The one in bay 7 is shipping to Austria on Thursday. No subcontractors. No weather delays. No surprises."

The difference: the first version tells you to feel something. The second version makes you feel it by showing what's real.

### Hook Formulas to Test

These are opening lines. The first line determines whether anyone reads the rest. Test all of these. Kill the ones that don't pull.

**The Specific Number:**
- "€47. That's our heating bill for the entire winter."
- "0.24 ACH. The Passivhaus limit is 0.6. We beat it by 60%."
- "337 tonnes. That's how much CO₂ one house saves over its lifetime."

**The Tension Opener:**
- "All insulation looks equal — until 4:00 PM." (this already worked: 1,164 reactions)
- "A bank told our client his house isn't real. He's been living in it for 6 months."
- "We built 5 homes in 15 days. The construction industry built excuses."

**The Personal Confession:**
- "I built a 200m² house for my family. I sleep in a 19m² module. Here's why."
- "We almost went bankrupt trying to do construction the old way."
- "My son was diagnosed with asthma. That's the actual reason this company exists."

**The Contrarian Claim:**
- "Solar panels on a concrete house are a band-aid on a bullet wound."
- "CLT uses double the timber for the same house. Nobody talks about this."
- "The EU's green building plan is failing our forests."

**The "Wait, What?" Question:**
- "Your home's CO₂ levels hit 2,000 ppm every night. Your brain doesn't work right above 1,000."
- "92% of construction projects are delayed. What if yours wasn't?"
- "You can configure a car online in 15 minutes. Why not a house?"

### What to Test Systematically

You don't know what works yet. You think you do because of the insulation post, but one post is not a pattern. Here's what to test:

**Hooks:** Run the same content idea with two different opening lines. One data-driven, one emotional. See which pulls more.

**Format:** Take one piece of content (e.g., straw vs polystyrene data). Post it as a carousel on Monday. Post the same core message as a text-only post the following week. Compare.

**Language:** Post the same carousel in German and English on different days. Track profile visits from DACH region for each.

**Length:** Test 800-character posts vs 1,500-character posts on the same type of content. The data says 800-1,200 is optimal but YOUR audience might be different.

**Tone:** Test engineer-voice (data, specs, zero emotion) vs founder-voice (personal story + data). See which generates more comments with actual substance vs generic reactions.

**Kill rule:** If a post format or hook style underperforms your average twice in a row, drop it. Don't give anything three chances. There are too many things to test.

## 5. VISUAL GUIDELINES — What actually works

### Carousels (Priority #1)

**Dimensions:** 1080 × 1350px (4:5 vertical). This takes maximum feed real estate on mobile, which is where 57% of LinkedIn usage happens.

**Slide count:** 8-10. Under 8 doesn't build enough momentum. Over 12 loses people.

**Words per slide:** 25-50 max. If you're writing paragraphs on slides, you're making a document, not a carousel.

**Slide 1 (The Hook):** No logo. No intro. Just the hook. Big text. One sentence. This slide's only job is to make someone swipe. Example: "We tested straw vs. polystyrene at 35°C." White or black background. Nothing else.

**Slides 2-8 (The Content):** One idea per slide. One data point per slide. Use contrast — if slide 2 shows polystyrene failing, slide 3 shows straw succeeding. Visual rhythm: data slide → insight slide → data slide → insight slide.

**Last Slide (The Close):** Not a CTA to your website. Not your logo. A provocative question or a single-sentence summary that makes people comment. "Would you live in a house made of straw?" works. "Visit biobuilds.com" doesn't.

**Design direction:** Clean. Not corporate-clean — engineering-clean. Think Dieter Rams, not McKinsey. Dark backgrounds with white text for data. Real photography of your product on lifestyle slides. No stock photos ever. Your houses are beautiful. Use them.

**Typography:** One font. Sans-serif. Bold for headlines, regular for supporting text. No decorative fonts. No gradients. No drop shadows. You're selling precision — the design should feel precise.

**Color palette:** Pull from your brand. But every carousel needs high contrast between background and text. If someone is scrolling at 7 AM on a bus in Munich, they need to read your slide in 0.5 seconds.

**Export:** PDF for upload to LinkedIn (this triggers the document/carousel format). Not images.

### Images

**What works:** Real photos from your factory, your builds, your clients' homes. Thermal camera images. Side-by-side comparisons. A wrapped module on a truck. A family standing in front of their just-delivered home. The Făgăraș mountain house drone shot.

**What doesn't work:** Renders (people are trained to distrust them). Stock photos. Over-designed infographics with 47 data points. Screenshots of your website.

**The single image rule:** If you're posting text + one image, that image needs to create a question. The wrapped white module with "YOUR PASSIVE HOME IS HERE" printed on it — that creates a question. A pretty exterior shot of a finished house — that doesn't. It's nice, but it doesn't stop a thumb.

### Video

**What works now:** Vertical (9:16 or 4:5). Under 90 seconds. Raw over polished. Subtitles mandatory (85% of LinkedIn video is watched on mute). Face-to-camera narration from Alin outperforms b-roll montages.

**What doesn't work:** Your 1-minute supercut videos with music and no narration. They look great. They generate 0 comments. The algorithm sees views but no conversation and deprioritizes them.

**The shift to make:** Instead of a polished 60-second edit of a house being assembled, try Alin holding a phone, standing on the site, saying "This family's house arrived 20 minutes ago. Right now it's on a truck behind me. By lunch, they'll have keys. Let me show you what's happening." That video, shaky and real, will outperform the cinematic version.

## 6. CHANNEL STRATEGY

### Alin's Personal Page = The Engine

This is where all high-value content originates. The algorithm gives personal profiles 5-10x the reach of company pages. Your own data confirms it perfectly (87 avg vs 25 avg).

**What goes here:**
- All carousels (data comparisons, educational, storytelling)
- All vulnerability/founder story posts
- All contrarian takes
- All behind-the-scenes narrated video
- All industry commentary

**Posting frequency:** 4-5x per week. Not daily. Jasmin Alić (240K followers) explicitly says forced daily posting hurts quality and the algorithm can tell. Post when you have something worth posting. If that's 3 times one week and 6 the next, fine.

**Profile optimization:** Alin's headline should not say "CEO at BIOBUILDS." It should say what he does for the reader. Something like: "Building carbon-negative passive homes. Shipped to your door in 21 days." The headline appears on every comment, every share, every notification. It's a micro-ad seen 1000x more than any post.

### BIOBUILDS Company Page = The Credibility Layer

The company page exists to do three things:
1. Repost Alin's best-performing posts (within 24-48 hours)
2. Post operational content that reinforces the brand's reality (factory footage, delivery videos, client stories)
3. Be the professional landing page for anyone who finds Alin's content and wants to verify the company is real

**What goes here:**
- Reposts of Alin's top posts (these distribute at ~60% of original reach)
- Client transformation stories
- Factory/production content
- Delivery videos
- Team content (humanize the operation)

**Posting frequency:** 2-3x per week maximum. Quality over quantity. The page's engagement metrics are already damaged — every 0-reaction post makes the next post's distribution worse.

**What NEVER goes here:**
- Job postings as regular posts (use LinkedIn's jobs feature)
- Year recaps
- Generic "happy holidays" posts
- Anything identical to what Alin posted

### Mateus's Role

You're the one building all of this. But consider whether you should also be posting from your own LinkedIn profile about the process of building BIOBUILDS — the marketing challenges, the cross-country expansion, the reality of being 19 and running marketing for an international company. That's a story people want to follow. It creates a second personal profile driving awareness to the same company. Test it.

### Employee Amplification

When Alin publishes a post, 3-5 BIOBUILDS team members engage within the first 15-20 minutes. NOT with "Great post!" — with substantive comments that add a different angle. The factory manager comments about what went into the build. An engineer comments with an extra technical detail. This triggers the golden hour signal and pulls the post into those employees' networks.

---

## 7. POSTING MECHANICS

**When:** Tuesday through Thursday. 8-10 AM CET. This hits the DACH morning commute plus EU professional browsing hours. Tuesday runs 20% higher engagement than Friday. Saturday and Sunday get 45% less engagement than weekday peaks.

Carousels perform best at 9-10:30 AM. Video at 8-9 AM. Text posts at 8-10 AM.

**Post length:** 800-1,200 characters for text posts. Below 5th-grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid). Short paragraphs. Line break every 2-3 lines. The "see more" fold on LinkedIn appears at ~210 characters on mobile — your first 210 characters ARE the hook. Treat them like a headline.

**Hashtags:** Maximum 3 per post. LinkedIn removed hashtag following and actively penalizes 3+ tags (29% less reach measured across 1.8M posts). Use only:
- #PassiveHouse (your core identifier)
- #HealthyHomes (emotional/health angle)
- One rotating niche tag relevant to the specific post

Never: #FutureOfLiving #ImpactOverEgo #CarbonSmart #DesignForPeace — these are vanity tags with zero discovery value. Kill them all.

**Links:** Never in the post body. Even though LinkedIn officially says there's no penalty, every independent dataset shows 25-60% less initial distribution for posts with links. If you absolutely need one, put it in the SECOND comment (not the first — self-commenting now hurts reach).

**The Golden Hour:** The first 60-90 minutes after posting determine ~70% of a post's total lifetime reach. Comments carry 2x the weight of likes during this window. Alin should be actively responding to every comment during this period. Have the team engage within 15-20 minutes with real, substantive comments.

**Self-commenting:** Don't. This was a hack that worked in 2023-2024. Van der Blom's 2025 data shows it now limits reach. Let someone else be the first commenter.

**Carousel upload:** Export as PDF. Upload natively (don't use third-party scheduling tools for carousels — some strip the document format and convert to image posts, which perform differently).

## 8. DO'S AND DON'TS

### DO

- Start every post with a specific number, a named person, or a tension-creating question
- Write for one audience segment per post (tag it internally)
- Use carousels for any content that has 3+ data points or a sequential reveal
- Show the factory, the process, the real thing — not renders, not stock photos
- Let Alin's voice carry emotion. Let the company page carry proof.
- Reply to every comment in the first 90 minutes
- Test two variations of the same content idea (different hooks, different formats) and track which pulled harder
- Post in German specifically for DACH reach (test engagement vs English versions)
- Use real energy bills, real temperature readings, real client quotes with names
- Kill any format or hook style that underperforms your average twice in a row

### DON'T

- Don't say "built in 3 weeks" as a headline ever again (use it as supporting context only)
- Don't use 📍💡💸🌿⚒️ emoji formatting (reads as marketing material, triggers engagement bait detection)
- Don't write "Tag someone who..." or "Comment if you agree" (classified as engagement bait, distribution throttled)
- Don't post the same content on both Alin's page and the company page (84% reach penalty for recycled content)
- Don't use more than 3 hashtags (29% reach penalty)
- Don't comment on your own post first (now hurts instead of helps)
- Don't post polished video without narration or story (looks good, generates zero comments, algorithm deprioritizes)
- Don't use "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "game-changer," "seamless," "elevate," or "unlock"
- Don't post philosophical claims without a verifiable fact within one sentence
- Don't post on the company page more than 3x/week (every low-engagement post damages future distribution)
- Don't post job listings as regular posts
- Don't post year recaps or generic holiday content
- Don't use AI-generated images (LinkedIn labels them, 30% reach penalty)
- Don't write "As a non-native English speaker, I've used AI to refine this post" (you're telling the algorithm to suppress you)
- Don't force daily posting (quality variance kills your authority score — post only when you have something that meets the bar)
