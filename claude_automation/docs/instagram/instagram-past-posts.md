Stop waiting. Start living. 🏡

For decades, homebuilding has been a game of chance, riddled with delays and hidden costs. This isn’t just frustrating; it impacts your life, your wallet, and your well-being.

Traditional construction is:

❌ Forever Delayed: 9 out of 10 homes are delayed.
❌ Wastefully Costly: 80%+ of projects go over budget.
❌ Inefficient: You end up paying the homes price 2-3x on heating over its lifetime.

The solution isn’t to work harder within this broken system. It’s to replace it.

Choose a home that is:

✅ Fully Prefabricated: Move-in your home in just 4 weeks, instead of 4 years.
✅ Radical Transparent: Your fixed price is guaranteed from day one.
✅ Certified Passivhau

## PATTERNS

**Static images destroy reels.** 41 images avg 339 likes + 71 follows. 20 reels avg 189 likes + 18 follows. ~4x more follow conversion on photos.

**The formula that works:** Winter + warm interior glow + nature + human presence. Posts #1, #5, #7, #10, #11, #12, #14, #25 all follow this. It's your visual signature.

**Lifestyle context beats product specs.** Porsche Taycan, Tesla, family moments, sunset decks — the audience engages with aspiration, not kWh.

**Saves are insanely high** — 93 avg per post. People are bookmarking your content like a wishlist. Strong purchase-intent signal.

**Wrapped modules always flop.** Posts #59, #61, #62 are consistently bottom. IG audience doesn't care about logistics.

**Testimonials = high trust, zero engagement.** Post #54 converts clients but tanks on feed. Route to paid/retargeting, not organic.

**Daily posting killed December.** 25 posts in 25 days = algorithm suppression. Space 2-3 days minimum.

**Facebook outperforms IG on cozy/emotional content.** Post #5 got 2,200 on FB vs much less on IG. Post #28 got 560 on FB. Consider platform-specific strategy.

## INSTAGRAM vs LINKEDIN

| | Instagram | LinkedIn |
|---|---|---|
| **What wins** | Lifestyle imagery — sunset decks, warm winter glow, families | Data-driven thought leadership — test results, comparisons, controversy |
| **Best format** | Static photos (4x more follows than reels) | Long-form text with numbers |
| **Audience wants** | The dream | The proof |
| **Worst content** | Wrapped modules, logistics, tech demos, expo invites | Generic future-of-construction without data or personal story |
| **Unique signal** | Saves (93 avg) = purchase intent | Comments/debate = industry authority |
| **Cross-post rule** | Cozy/aspirational → IG + FB priority | Data/controversy/vulnerability → LinkedIn priority |

**Still pending images:** Posts #31-51
