## The Origin

BIOBUILDS did not start with a business plan.

In 2010, Alin Muste's son was diagnosed with asthma. He was a father before he was an entrepreneur. And when his child couldn't breathe, he went looking for why. What he found changed everything: the materials inside conventional homes release chemicals that attack our respiratory systems. The walls we trust to protect our families are quietly poisoning them.

He couldn't accept that. So he built something else.

That refusal is the foundation of everything BIOBUILDS has become. Not a market opportunity. Not a trend. A father who looked at the way homes are built and said: this is not good enough for my family. And if it's not good enough for mine, it's not good enough for yours either.

## The Three Pillars

Every decision at BIOBUILDS is filtered through three non-negotiable principles, discovered in sequence but inseparable by design.

### Health (2010)
The construction industry uses materials that cause 3.8 million deaths per year from indoor air pollution. We spend over 80% of our lives indoors. BIOBUILDS homes are built from 98% organic materials with zero-formaldehyde interiors, medical-grade ventilation that filters 99% of dust and allergens, and continuous fresh air circulation. The home itself becomes a health system.

### Efficiency (2010–2011)
Most homeowners pay for their house twice. Once at purchase. Then every month, for the rest of their lives, in energy bills that never stop climbing. Over 70% of homes in the EU fail to meet minimum efficiency standards. BIOBUILDS Modular is Passivhaus-certified by the Institute in Darmstadt, the strictest energy standard in the world. Energy demand: 15 kWh/m²/year. The EU average: 350. That's not an improvement. That's a different category.

### Sustainability (2011–2012)
You cannot build a sanctuary for the family while destroying the future of the planet. Every BIOBUILDS home has a net-negative carbon footprint: -101 kg CO₂e per m² across manufacturing stages. 337 tonnes of CO₂ saved per house built. The walls store more carbon than they emit. Every home is a net contributor to carbon reduction, certified by EPD International.

## The Technical Foundation

This is not a container with marketing. This is engineering at the highest certified standard on Earth.

### Wall Assembly (EW1)
336 mm composite system. U-value: 0.14 W/m²K. Breathable, vapor-open, zero thermal bridges. Yakisugi or Lunawood exterior (ventilated rainscreen), Agepan DWD sheathing, 300 mm timber/wood-fiber insulation, ECO OSB 3 inner lining (formaldehyde-free, Passive House approved), smart membrane airtightness.

### Glazing
Triple-glazed, argon/krypton fill. Center-of-glass Ug ≤ 0.5 W/m²K. Genesis 90 aluminium profiles from Aliplast. Passivhaus-certified. Internal surface temperature stays above 17°C in winter.

### Airtightness
0.24–0.5 ACH at 50 Pa. The Passivhaus threshold is 0.6. We exceed it significantly. Achieved through smart membrane interior airtightness and DWD board exterior airtightness. A fully sealed thermal envelope with controlled vapor diffusion. 30x more airtight than a conventional home.

### Ventilation
Zehnder MVHR systems. 95% heat recovery. Medical-grade filters. Passivhaus-certified. Silent operation. Paired with Panasonic heat pumps.

### Carbon Sequestration
Net-negative carbon footprint across A1–A3 stages. -101 kg CO₂e per m². 36.31 kg biogenic carbon stored in timber per m². EPD International certified. Negative GWP means the building stores more carbon in bio-based materials than is emitted during manufacturing.

### Smart Systems (Turnkey)
Philips Hue / IKEA TRADFRI smart lighting. Exterior smart blinds (>99% UV blocking). Schneider Electric outlets (CE/VDE, Made in Germany). Flexible LED track lighting.

### Bathroom (Turnkey)
Grohe wall-hung WC (Made in Germany). Italian-design composite sink. Walk-in shower (Made in France). Triple-layer natural wood parquet. In the bathroom. Because natural always feels best.

### Exterior
Two facade options: Yakisugi (charred wood) and Lunawood (thermally modified). Ventilated rainscreen. Fire resistant. Low maintenance.

## The Milestones

**2010** — Alin's son diagnosed with asthma. Research into building materials begins.

**2010–2011** — Discovery of Passivhaus standard. Efficiency becomes a pillar.

**2011–2012** — Sustainability becomes the third pillar. The equation completes.

**2013–2016** — **RIA.** The world's most efficient prefabricated house. 2 kWh/m²/year. Subject of hundreds of academic studies and doctorates. International recognition. Not the end of the journey. The beginning of BIOBUILDS.

**2016–2021** — **SOL Residence.** First street of passive houses. 12 kWh/m²/year (28x more efficient than average). Straw insulation panels. The hybrid model reveals its limits: factory quality cannot survive the construction site.

**2020–2025** — **Modular.** Built from scratch. 99% factory construction. World's first modular system certified by Passivhaus Darmstadt. The chaos of the construction site, completely eliminated.

**2024** — European launch.

## The Lesson We Learned the Hard Way

Between 2016 and 2021, BIOBUILDS tried a hybrid system. Half prefabricated, half on-site. It failed. Subcontractors without rigor. Delays. Poor execution. Factory quality was lost on the ground.

The lesson was decisive: to guarantee 100% of the quality of BIOBUILDS, we must control 100% of the process.

That's why Modular exists. Not as a product evolution, but as a philosophical commitment. If you can't control the outcome, you can't promise the standard.

## The Competitive Position

### What Only BIOBUILDS Can Say

Every line of copy must pass the "Only BIOBUILDS" test. If a container home, a timber-frame competitor, or a conventional builder could say the same thing, it doesn't belong in our communication.

**Ownable claims:**
- Built because a child couldn't breathe. Now the strictest standard on Earth.
- World's first modular system certified by Passivhaus Darmstadt.
- RIA: the most efficient prefab house ever built. Subject of hundreds of academic studies.
- SOL: the first street of passive houses.
- Carbon-negative by EPD International certification (-101 kg CO₂e/m²).
- 21-day production. Factory to move-in.
- 200+ passive houses delivered. 5.0 Google Reviews.
- 337 tonnes CO₂ saved per home.

### The Villain

**Traditional construction is the enemy. Not competitors.**

The system that takes 3 years. Goes 90% over budget. Uses materials that poison the air. Wastes energy forever. Traps families in a cycle of maintenance and compromise.

We don't compete with other prefab companies. We compete with the old way of building.

## Who We Serve

They are not buying a house. They are buying back their time, their health, their energy independence, and their alignment with the future.

They make decisions based on research, not impulse. They have seen every claim. They distrust bold promises. They respond to mechanisms, not slogans. Real people with real results.

Families. Engineers. Entrepreneurs. Remote workers. People who chose to think differently about the biggest purchase of their lives.

---

## How We Write

### The Voice

Confident. Not arrogant. We write like a company that has already changed the industry and knows it. The tone is warm but direct. Short declarative sentences. No hedging. No qualification. Emotion first, data second.

### The Rules

1. **Sell emotion first. Use data to back it up, not replace it.** Never lead with a wall of numbers. Make someone feel something. Then prove it.

2. **Write only what BIOBUILDS can uniquely claim.** If any competitor could use the same sentence, delete it.

3. **No AI clichés.** No "revolutionary." No "cutting-edge." No "game-changer." No "seamless." No "elevate." No "unlock." Write like a human who believes in what they're selling.

4. **No em-dashes.** Ever. Use periods. Use commas. Full stops create rhythm.

5. **Short sentences. Parallel structure. Rhythm matters.** The copy should feel like it was written by someone who reads more than they write.

6. **Traditional construction is the villain.** Not other companies. The problem is the system. We are the exit.

7. **Ask questions that create mental gaps.** "You pay for your house twice." The reader has to keep going. The question does the selling.

8. **Respect the client's intelligence.** No hype. No desperation. No hard sell. Present the truth and let it work.

9. **End on the client's transformed life. Not the product.** The last image in the reader's mind should be their new reality, not our spec sheet.

10. **The origin story is the ultimate differentiator.** A father who couldn't accept the air his child was breathing. Every piece of communication can trace back to this. No container home, no competitor, no conventional builder can touch it.
