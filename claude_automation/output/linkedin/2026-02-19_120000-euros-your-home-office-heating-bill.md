EUR 120,000. That's your home office heating bill over 20 years.

Fraunhofer IFAM published the number last month. An unrenovated German single-family home with gas heating: EUR 120,000 in heating costs over two decades. Grid fees alone are set to climb tenfold as neighbors leave the gas network.

Now add remote work. You're home all day. The boiler runs 14 hours instead of 6.

In Romania, the math is different but the problem is the same. Families build 200 m² with zero mechanical ventilation. By 2 PM, CO2 passes 2,000 ppm. Your concentration drops 50%. You open a window, lose all your heat, and the gas meter keeps spinning.

I work from a 19 m² module. Zehnder MVHR cycles fresh air every two hours. CO2 never crosses 800 ppm. Heating cost last January: EUR 12.

The difference isn't willpower. It's the envelope.

336 mm of wood-fiber insulation. 0.14 W/m²K walls. Triple glazing at Ug 0.5. 54 dB sound reduction. No road noise. No neighbor noise. Just 28 dB and enough oxygen to think straight until 6 PM.

KfW 300 currently funds EH40 homes at rates starting from 0.01%. In Romania, the same Passivhaus-certified home costs EUR 1,676/m². In Germany, EUR 4,800/m².

Designed to keep you warm. Built to keep you sharp.

What does your home office sound like at 2 PM?
