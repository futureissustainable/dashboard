90% of your life happens indoors. Most homes are designed like it doesn't.

The WHO estimates Europeans spend roughly 90% of their waking hours inside buildings. A study across eight European cities (the LARES project) found that people who reported "turning on a light even on bright days because natural light wasn't enough" had measurably higher rates of depression.

We obsess over square meters. Nobody asks about lux.

When we designed our Modular system, the glazing wasn't an afterthought. It was the starting point. Triple-glazed, argon-filled, Ug of 0.5 W/m2K. Floor-to-ceiling on the south face. The inner glass surface stays above 17°C even when it's minus 10 outside. You don't get cold drafts. You get a wall of daylight that shifts across your floor from morning to evening.

Romania's building code requires a Natural Light Factor of just 1%. Germany's EN 17037 pushed that baseline higher, but most conventional builds still treat windows as holes in the insulation. The Fertighaus market now accounts for over 25% of German single-family homes, and the best ones are finally catching up to what Passivhaus has demanded for years: design the envelope around light, not despite it.

I've watched families walk into our homes for the first time. The reaction is always the same. They don't comment on the energy rating. They stand still and say: it's so bright in here.

That's not a feature. That's the whole point.

How much natural light does your current home actually get?
