EUR 38,000. That's what the average German homeowner spends on facade maintenance over 30 years. Repainting every 7 years. Patching plaster. Replacing cracked render. The house looks good on day one. Then it starts asking for money.

In Romania, the timeline is worse. Polystyrene facades yellow within 3 years. Traditional plaster cracks after the first hard winter. Families pour EUR 2,000-4,000 into repainting before the mortgage is halfway done.

Our facades are Yakisugi. Charred Japanese cypress. No paint. No render. No chemical treatment.

The charring creates a carbon layer that repels water, resists insects, and blocks UV. It doesn't fade. It evolves. Five years in, the texture deepens. Ten years in, it looks better than the day we installed it.

Zero repainting. Zero chemical maintenance. One 18th-century technique doing what polymer coatings can't.

We pair it with a ventilated rainscreen gap that lets the wall breathe. Moisture passes through, never trapped. That's why our walls still test at 0.14 W/m²K after years of Carpathian winters and Bavarian rain.

KfW 300 just dropped rates to 0.29% effective this month. Up to EUR 270,000 for EH40 + QNG families. A home that costs less to finance and less to maintain.

Design isn't how a house looks at the open house. It's how it looks in 2046.
