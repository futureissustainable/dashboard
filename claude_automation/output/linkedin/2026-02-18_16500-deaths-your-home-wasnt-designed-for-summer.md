16,500 Europeans died from heat last summer. Most of them were indoors.

Not on construction sites. Not in fields. Inside their own homes.

The Grantham Institute tracked it across 12 cities. Milan. Barcelona. Berlin. 2,300 dead in a single ten-day wave.

Their homes were designed to keep heat in. Nobody planned for 40°C in Munich.

We tested our Modular at 35°C outside. Interior stayed at 24°C. No AC running. 336 mm of wood-fiber insulation doesn't just block cold. It blocks heat. Thermal lag: 12+ hours. By the time the sun's energy reaches your bedroom, it's midnight and 19°C outside.

Conventional insulation surrenders in 6 hours. By 4 PM, your living room is 29°C.

Germany's energy demand during heatwaves has risen fivefold since 1979. Romania hit 42°C last July. Only 19% of European homes have AC.

The KfW 300 program now funds EH40 homes at 0.10% interest. Our system qualifies. In Romania, the same home costs EUR 1,676/m² versus EUR 4,800/m² in Germany. Same Passivhaus certification on both sides.

Good design isn't just how a space looks. It's whether that space can keep you alive in August.

Ask your builder what happens at 35°C. The answer will tell you everything.
