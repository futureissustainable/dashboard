42% of German homes have one occupant. The average Romanian new build has 3+ empty bedrooms. We're all designing for a life we don't live.

Destatis confirmed it last year. Germany's single-person households are now the majority type. In Romania, families build 200 m² because their parents grew up cramped. Then half the rooms sit dark within a decade.

Our 48 m² Wanderlust is the most popular module we ship. Couples near Bucharest and retirees near Salzburg order the same plan.

It heats for under EUR 15/month. Passivhaus certified at 15 kWh/m²/year. 95% heat recovery. Triple glazing, Ug 0.5.

When life changes, you bolt on a second module. Ground screws, no concrete. A family near Sibiu started at 48 m². Their daughter arrived. We added a bedroom in one day. Total: 72 m².

KfW 300 funds EH40 homes for families at 0.10% interest. In Romania, the same build runs EUR 1,676/m² versus EUR 4,800/m² in Germany. Same certification both sides.

Good design isn't building big. It's building right, then adapting when life does.

What did you build for? The life you have, or the one you imagined ten years ago?
