A blindfolded study gave people four surfaces to touch. Steel, tile, marble, oak. Only the oak lowered their heart rate.

I think about that every time I walk into one of our homes.

98% of what you touch inside a BioBuilds home is organic. Timber frame. Wood-fiber insulation. Cork. Natural parquet. Your nervous system registers it before your eyes do.

A UBC study confirmed it: exposed wood indoors lowers sympathetic nervous activity the same way a forest walk does.

The average European spends 90% of their time inside concrete and painted drywall.

Germany has 49 m² per person. Romania has 15 m². But the material matters more than the size.

Clients in Bucharest moved from 120 m² apartments into 48 m² modules and told us they sleep better. CO2 stays below 800 ppm all night. Zehnder MVHR recovers 95% of heat while cycling fresh air every two hours.

In the DACH market, KfW 300 now offers up to EUR 270,000 at 0.01% for EH40 + QNG homes. Our Modular qualifies.

Wood isn't a design trend. It's a physiological input.

What materials are you surrounded by right now?
