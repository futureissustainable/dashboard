66,000 Europeans died from noise last year. Not factory noise. Home noise.

The EEA's 2025 report confirmed it. Traffic bleeding through thin walls. 110 million people exposed above 55 dB every day.

Your bedroom should sit below 30 dB.
Most European homes hover around 45.

I stood inside RIA at 6 AM last January. Decibel meter read 28 dB. Outside: trucks on the county road. Inside: I could hear my own breathing.

336 mm of wood-fiber insulation does that.
54 dB of sound reduction. No added acoustic treatment.

In Munich, the average household now pays EUR 98/month just to heat a home that lets every ambulance siren through the window. In Bucharest, families spend EUR 50-80/month heating apartments where you can hear your neighbor's TV through the wall.

Our Modular costs about EUR 25/month to heat. And the noise stays outside.

KfW 300 now funds EH40 homes for families at 0.10% interest, up to EUR 270,000. Our system qualifies. Silence and savings in the same envelope.

Good design isn't about how a home looks. It's about what it keeps out.

Check your phone's decibel meter tonight at 2 AM. That number is shaping your health more than your diet.
