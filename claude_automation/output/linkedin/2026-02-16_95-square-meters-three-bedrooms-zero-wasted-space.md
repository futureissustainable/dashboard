95 m². Three bedrooms. Zero wasted space.

Romania has the smallest homes in the EU. 15 m² of living space per person. 41% of households are overcrowded. Germany is the opposite problem: 42% of homes have a single occupant, and rooms sit empty.

Both countries build the wrong way.

In Romania, families chase square meters because they grew up cramped. So they build 200 m² with a 3-year timeline, blown budgets, and hallways nobody uses.

In Germany, the Fertighaus market now covers 1 in 4 new single-family homes. But even there, most designs still waste 15-20% of floor area on circulation space that adds cost and heating load.

We obsessed over this. Our 95 m² Serenity model packs three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and an open kitchen-living area into a footprint that heats for about EUR 25/month. Passivhaus certified at 15 kWh/m²/year. The open plan isn't a trend choice. It eliminates corridors, cuts structural walls, and lets daylight reach every corner.

At EUR 1,676/m² in Romania versus EUR 4,800/m² in Germany, every square meter you don't waste saves real money on both sides of the continent.

A 2025 Frontiers study found that homes with natural materials and open sightlines to greenery reduce cortisol by up to 15%. You don't need a bigger house for that. You need a smarter one.

What would you prioritize in 95 m²?
