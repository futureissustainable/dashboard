Your home is the first thing you feel in the morning. Before coffee. Before your phone. Before anything.

Most people wake up in rooms that fight them. Low ceilings pressing down. Small windows rationing light like it costs something. Walls made of materials that off-gas chemicals you can't pronounce but your lungs already know.

We tested something different.

Floor-to-ceiling glazing that turns a February morning into therapy. Slatted wood walls you want to run your hand across. 98% organic materials, so the air inside isn't just filtered, it was never contaminated in the first place. The ventilation system recovers 95% of heat while cycling fresh air every two hours. You don't notice it working. You notice yourself sleeping deeper after the first week.

The family in this photo moved in on a Thursday. By Saturday they'd rearranged the furniture twice. Not because the layout was wrong. Because the light kept showing them new ways to use the space.

That's what happens when a home is built around how light moves, not how plumbing fits.

Passivhaus certified modular home by BIOBUILDS. 15 kWh per square meter per year. The EU average is 350.

Your body knows the difference before your mind does.
