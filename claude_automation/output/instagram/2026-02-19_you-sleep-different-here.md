creative_brief: "Bedroom at blue hour, shot from inside looking out through floor-to-ceiling triple-glazed windows. A woman or couple in bed, white linen, bare feet visible, clearly just waking up or drifting off. The bedroom is warm wood (slatted ceiling or timber wall), minimal, lived-in. Through the glass: a winter forest, snow on branches, blue twilight. One bedside lamp casts a warm amber glow. The contrast is physical: frozen world outside, cocoon warmth inside. No perfect staging. A book left open on the nightstand. A glass of water. Real life. The mood should make the viewer feel the warmth through their screen. Shot on phone or phone-quality preferred. 4:5 vertical, 1080x1350px."

Your old apartment: 22 degrees with the radiator screaming. This bedroom: 24 degrees in silence.

The walls are 336mm of wood and air. The windows hold more heat than your radiator ever did. The ventilation replaces every breath with filtered forest air, and recovers 95% of the warmth on its way out.

You don't hear it. You don't see it. You just sleep like you haven't slept in years.

Passivhaus certified modular home by BIOBUILDS. 21 days from factory to this moment.
