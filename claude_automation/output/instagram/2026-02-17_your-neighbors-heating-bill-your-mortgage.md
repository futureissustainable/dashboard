creative_brief: "A BIOBUILDS home at blue hour, late winter evening. Warm golden light flooding through floor-to-ceiling triple-glazed windows. Inside: a couple on the couch, wine glasses, a fire-effect light. Outside: frost on the deck railing, snow on the ground, breath-visible cold. Shot from outside looking in, so the viewer sees the life they don't have yet. The contrast between the freezing exterior and the effortlessly warm interior must be so strong it creates physical longing. No logos. No text overlay. The image should feel stolen, like someone walking past this house at night and thinking: that's the life I want. 4:5 vertical ratio, 1080x1350px."
