creative_note: "Catalog item #2: Dark moody living room, woman working on laptop with cat, slatted wood ceiling, abstract art, designer floor lamp. This creative shows the exact life the target audience wants: working from home in a space that feels like a retreat, not a compromise. The cat, the moody lighting, the design-forward ceiling all create visceral desire. Hits remote-work lifestyle angle perfectly for Romanian IT professionals and DACH knowledge workers."
