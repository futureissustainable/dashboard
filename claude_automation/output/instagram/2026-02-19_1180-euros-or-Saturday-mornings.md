creative_brief: "A family kitchen on a Saturday morning in winter. Shot from the living room looking toward the open kitchen. A dad making pancakes with a toddler on his hip. A mug of coffee steaming on the counter. Through the floor-to-ceiling triple-glazed windows behind them: a frozen landscape, snow-covered garden, grey winter sky. The interior is warm, golden, effortless. Slatted wood ceiling, natural oak floors, soft light. The feeling should be: this family is not worried about anything. No coats inside. No radiator visible. The warmth is invisible and total. Slightly imperfect framing, like the mom took this on her phone from the couch. 4:5 vertical, 1080x1350px."

German households paid EUR 1,180 to heat their homes last winter. This family paid under EUR 100. For the whole year.

The difference bought them every Saturday morning like this one.

Passivhaus certified modular home by BIOBUILDS. 200+ families across Europe already made the switch.
