creative_brief: "A BIOBUILDS home at golden hour, late winter. The shot is from a slight distance, showing the full exterior with surroundings: a hillside clearing, trees, maybe a valley view. The architecture is striking, modern, warm wood cladding (Yakisugi or Lunawood). A couple stands on the deck with wine glasses, looking out at the landscape. The home looks like it was designed by a world-class architect for this exact spot. Neighbors' traditional houses visible in soft focus in the background for subtle contrast. Snow remnants on the ground, warm light pouring through the panoramic triple-glazed windows. The mood is aspirational but real, phone-quality feel preferred over glossy rendering. 4:5 vertical ratio, 1080x1350px."
