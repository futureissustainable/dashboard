I downsized from a 78m2 Munich rental to a 48m2 timber modular home. 14 months later, here's what the daily reality looks like.

So I was paying €1,480/month for a 78m2 apartment in Munich (Schwabing, nothing fancy, third floor, loud street). I'm half Dutch, half German, work remote for a Dutch SaaS company, and by early 2024 I was genuinely questioning why I was handing over €17,760 a year for a place where I used maybe 40m2 of the actual space on any given day.

My partner and I had been looking at tiny homes and small modular places for about a year. Not in a "let's go off-grid and raise chickens" way, more like: can we get a well-built, healthy, small home near nature and stop bleeding money on rent in a city we barely enjoy anymore?

Short answer: yes. But the details matter, and I want to be honest about what works and what doesn't.

## What we ended up with

A 48m2 timber-frame modular home, placed on ground screws on a leased plot near Starnberger See (about 40 min from Munich). Open living/kitchen area, one bedroom, one bathroom, small utility/storage space. Triple-glazed windows, mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, timber and wood fiber insulation throughout.

The thing was factory-built and delivered in modules. Total time from order to move-in was about 4 months (the factory part was 3 weeks, but permits and site prep took forever, as they do in Germany).

## The design stuff nobody warned me about

**What actually matters at 48m2:**

- **Ceiling height.** Ours is 2.7m, and honestly it's the single biggest reason the place doesn't feel cramped. Some modular manufacturers go standard 2.5m. Don't. That 20cm makes an absurd difference in how you perceive the space.

- **Window placement > window size.** We have one big south-facing triple-glazed unit (Ug 0.5 W/m2K) and two smaller east windows. The big one heats the living area passively in winter and floods the space with light. Interior surface temperature stays above 17C even in January. But the real trick is the sightline, you can see trees from every spot in the living room and it makes the whole place feel twice as big.

- **Timber walls as the interior finish.** We went with exposed timber on most walls (CLT panels, light birch on one accent wall). Zero paint. This was polarizing when we showed friends, but 14 months in, I'm completely sold. The smell of wood is still there. Air quality readings (we have a Netatmo sensor) consistently show CO2 under 600 ppm with the MVHR running, and humidity sits at 42-48% year round. Conventional apartments I've rented were 800+ ppm by morning and 30-35% humidity in winter.

- **Storage is the actual design challenge.** We built in under-bed drawers, a wall-mounted fold-out desk, kitchen with no upper cabinets (open shelving), and we still had to purge about 40% of our stuff. If you're doing compact living, budget twice what you think for built-in storage.

## Some numbers, because this sub likes numbers

| Thing | Our 48m2 modular | Munich apartment (78m2) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly housing cost | ~€620 (plot lease + insurance + maintenance reserve) | €1,480 (rent) |
| Heating cost, December 2025 | €18 | ~€135 (gas + Nebenkosten share) |
| Annual energy consumption | ~3,200 kWh total (heat pump + MVHR + appliances) | ~7,800 kWh equivalent |
| Indoor temp, Jan 2026 | 21.2C average (no radiators running that week, just solar gain + internal heat) | Thermostat fights: 19-23C depending on the radiator gods |
| CO2 indoor morning | 480-580 ppm | 850-1100 ppm (window cracked or not) |
| Noise from outside | Almost nothing (54 dB rated walls, triple glazing) | Police sirens at 2am (0 dB rating on 1970s windows) |

The heating thing still surprises me. Our place meets Passivhaus-level performance (15 kWh/m2/year heating demand, airtightness tested at 0.4 ACH at 50 Pa). I knew the theory. Living it is different. We had a week in January where it hit minus 8C outside and the indoor temp never dropped below 20.4C without actively heating. The ventilation system recovers 95% of the heat from outgoing air, and with two people, a laptop, and cooking, internal gains do a lot of the work.

## Timber and natural materials, the honest version

The "warm minimalism" trend (Dezeen had a whole piece on "curated calm" being the 2026 interior theme) maps pretty well onto what living in a timber modular actually feels like. Untreated wood, simple lines, lots of light. It looks good.

But here's what nobody on Instagram will tell you:

- **Wood moves.** Small cracks appeared in some CLT panels during the first winter as humidity dropped. Completely normal structurally, but if you need perfect smooth walls, go with drywall over timber.

- **Maintenance is real.** Wood fiber insulation and timber structure means you have to stay on top of ventilation filter changes (every 6 months, ~€30/filter). Exterior cladding (we went Lunawood, thermally modified timber) needs inspection annually. It's low maintenance, not zero maintenance.

- **Acoustics inside are different.** Wood reflects sound differently than plaster. We added a wool rug and some soft panels, and it's fine now, but the first week felt echo-y.

The materials question is interesting when you compare across manufacturers. I looked at maybe 15 European modular companies over about 6 months. Here's the rough landscape:

- **Baltic manufacturers** (NorgesHus, CMB Housing from Latvia): cheapest entry point, NorgesHus starts around €25K for a shell. Mostly standard timber frame, not Passivhaus certified, but solid builds. Design is functional, not fancy.
- **German premium** (SchwörerHaus "Flying Spaces", WeberHaus): gorgeous, but starting at €280K+ for anything liveable. The design quality is undeniable though.
- **Design-forward** (OOD from Estonia, Ark Shelter from Belgium): incredible aesthetics, the OOD mirror houses are stunning. They just raised €10M. But they're not Passivhaus certified and pricing is €60-77K for pretty small units.
- **Eastern European certified** (BioBuilds from Romania): this was the wild card. Passivhaus certified by PHI Darmstadt, 98% organic materials, carbon negative, starting around €40K for a 24m2 unit. They're the only Passivhaus certified modular manufacturer in Romania. Manufacturing costs are lower there (average construction costs in Romania are about €1,676/m2 vs Germany's €4,800/m2), so the pricing makes sense. We visited the factory near Cluj.
- **Scandi-style** (Koto Design from UK, Manta North): beautiful design language, strong on hospitality projects, less focused on energy certification.

We went with a smaller German-speaking manufacturer I won't name (because it's a friend-of-a-friend situation and I don't want to commercialize that relationship). But the point is: you've got real options across Europe now, and the gap between "cheap basic box" and "€300K dream home" has filled in dramatically over the last 2-3 years.

## What I'd do differently

1. **Get the permits sorted BEFORE ordering.** Our factory time was 21 days. Permits took 11 weeks. Sequence matters.
2. **Invest in one great piece of furniture** instead of trying to fill every corner. Our handmade oak dining table (doubles as my desk) was €1,200 and it defines the whole living space.
3. **Plan your exterior living space.** We added a simple covered deck (16m2, about €3,800 installed) and it basically doubles our usable space from April to October.
4. **Don't underestimate ground screws vs. foundation.** We saved roughly €8,000 going with ground screws instead of a poured foundation. The structural engineer said they're actually better for our soil type, and if we ever want to relocate the home, we can.

## Would I go back to a city apartment?

No. Full stop. And it's not just the money (though saving €800+/month is nice). It's the air quality, the quiet, waking up and seeing trees instead of the Lidl across the street. The "warm minimalism" lifestyle media talks about isn't really a design trend, it's just what happens when you build with wood and let in light.

But I want to be honest: 48m2 with two people requires constant negotiation about space. We have a rule, if you bring something in, something goes out. And working from home in the living area means my partner sometimes retreats to the bedroom just for quiet. We're already thinking about adding a 24m2 module as a dedicated office in maybe 2 years.

Compact living isn't for everyone. But if you're paying insane rent in a European city and you can work remote, the math is hard to argue with.

**TL;DR:** Moved from a €1,480/month Munich rental (78m2) to a 48m2 timber modular home. Heating costs: €18/month in December vs ~€135 previously. Indoor CO2 stays under 600 ppm (vs 1000+ in the apartment). Energy use dropped from ~7,800 kWh to ~3,200 kWh annually. European modular market has real options now from ~€25K (Baltic basic) to €300K+ (German premium). After 14 months, I'd never go back to renting, but 48m2 with two people requires real commitment to decluttering and shared space.

**Post title:** "Cozy 15m2 Cabin Facing Its First Winter"
**Why comment here:** Owner sharing first winter experience in a small cabin, perfect place to add real data about heating performance and insulation choices in compact timber homes.

**Recommended comment:**
> Beautiful setup. Curious what your wall insulation thickness is and whether you went with mechanical ventilation?
>
> I ask because the condensation-free windows suggest good glazing, but the real test in a 15m2 space is moisture management. With two people cooking and sleeping in that volume, you're generating roughly 6-8 liters of moisture per day. Without an MVHR (mechanical ventilation with heat recovery), you're either opening windows and losing heat or getting mold within 2-3 winters.
>
> For reference, the Passivhaus standard targets 0.6 ACH at 50 Pa airtightness, which basically forces you into mechanical ventilation. But even non-certified builds benefit from it. A basic MVHR unit runs around €1,500-2,500 installed, recovers 85-95% of heat from outgoing air, and keeps indoor CO2 under 1000 ppm. Best €2K I ever spent on my place.

**Post title:** "Our new 30m2 full-time tiny home (with more pictures)"
**Why comment here:** Romania-built modular tiny home (Wild'in), great thread to add data about timber material choices and long-term living in compact European homes.

**Recommended comment:**
> Love the wood color on this. Is that thermally modified timber on the exterior?
>
> I've been looking at a lot of European compact builds and the exterior cladding choice matters more than people think. Regular untreated softwood needs re-staining every 2-3 years. Thermally modified wood (Lunawood, Thermowood, etc.) lasts 25-30 years with minimal maintenance because the heat treatment process changes the cell structure and makes it resistant to moisture and decay, no chemicals needed.
>
> The price difference is roughly €35-50/m2 more upfront, but you save on maintenance every year after that. For a 30m2 home you're looking at maybe €800-1,500 more total, and it pays for itself within 4-5 years of not having to re-treat.
>
> How's the interior humidity holding up? At 30m2 with full-time living, that's usually where the real design challenge is.

**Why comment here:** Couple sharing newly delivered shell tiny home, relevant thread to add data about design considerations for finishing interiors in compact spaces.

**Recommended comment:**
> Congrats on getting it landed! The shell-and-finish-yourself route is underrated, you can save 30-40% vs turnkey and control material quality.
>
> A few things I learned finishing ours that I wish someone told me earlier:
>
> 1. **Ceiling height is everything in a small footprint.** If you have any flexibility to go above 2.5m standard, do it. Going to 2.7m made our place feel dramatically more open. Costs almost nothing extra in materials.
> 2. **Skip upper kitchen cabinets.** Open shelving on one wall keeps the sightlines open and makes the kitchen feel like part of the living area, not a separate box. We saved about $600 and gained way more visual space.
> 3. **Invest in one good window placement rather than many small ones.** One large south-facing window does more for livability than four small ones scattered around. Solar gain alone can raise interior temp 3-4C on a sunny winter day, and the sightline to nature makes compact spaces feel double their size.

> What's your insulation plan? That'll drive every comfort decision from here.
