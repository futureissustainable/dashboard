I'm an architect who designed my family's 95m2 modular home from scratch. Here's what I learned about the design process across 8 European manufacturers.

I'm going to be honest: even though I design homes for a living, designing my own was harder than any client project I've done. When it's your family's house, your wife's opinions, your kids' bedrooms, the spot where you'll drink coffee every morning for the next 20 years, the stakes feel completely different.

We built a 95m2 modular timber home near Stuttgart, moved in September 2025, and I'm writing this now after our first full winter. But the interesting part isn't the house itself. It's the 11 months I spent before that talking to manufacturers across Europe, comparing what "customizable" actually means, and learning that the design process varies wildly depending on who builds your home and where.

## Why modular, why now

Quick context. I'm Italian, moved to Germany in 2014, married a German woman, two kids (5 and 2). We were renting a 110m2 apartment in Stuttgart for EUR 1,650/month and I'd been saying "we should build" for years. In 2024, with the average new-build cost in Germany sitting at around EUR 4,800/m2 and mortgage rates at 3.5-4%, I finally committed to doing it properly.

As an architect, I knew site-built in Germany would mean 18-24 months of construction, budget overruns, and me wanting to divorce the GU (general contractor). Modular was always the obvious answer for me. Factory conditions, controlled quality, weather-independent, predictable timeline. The KfW 297/298 program offering subsidized loans up to EUR 150,000 at around 2.3-2.7% for EH40+ standard sealed the deal. Getting KfW funding basically requires hitting energy performance targets that modular manufacturers are already building to. Passivhaus standard, which targets max 15 kWh/m2/year heating demand and airtightness of 0.6 ACH at 50 Pa, exceeds EH40 requirements.

## The 8 manufacturers I talked to (and what "design flexibility" actually means)

Here's where it gets interesting. I contacted manufacturers across 4 countries and the experience was so different that I started keeping notes. Not just on price and specs, but on how much input I actually had on the floor plan, the materials, the window positions, everything.

**German premium tier:**

- **SchwörerHaus (Flying Spaces):** Beautiful product. Excellent engineering. But their modular line is essentially pre-configured units. You pick from their catalog. I asked about moving a bathroom wall 40cm and repositioning a window on the south facade and got a "that's not how our modules work" response. Price: around EUR 4,500/m2 turnkey for the module, before site works. Design freedom: 3/10.

- **Baufritz:** Absolutely gorgeous bio-based construction. They do allow more customization but their starting point is north of EUR 320K, and for a 95m2 home the all-in was quoted at roughly EUR 5,200/m2. I could customize everything, but the budget said no. Design freedom: 8/10. Affordability: 3/10.

**Baltic value tier:**

- **NorgesHus (Latvia):** Shell from EUR 25K is the headline. But "shell" means unfinished. No interior walls in some configurations. No electrical. No plumbing. I estimated another EUR 40-55K to finish a 95m2 shell to liveable standard, potentially more if I wanted decent insulation and windows. The design is flexible because you're basically getting a timber skeleton and doing the rest yourself. Design freedom: 7/10 (if you're willing to manage the build). Risk: high, you're your own project manager.

- **CMB Housing (Latvia):** More complete than NorgesHus. They offer near-Passivhaus performance from around EUR 57,600 for their compact units. Floor plan flexibility was moderate. They have a design team but response times were 2-3 weeks for revisions. Language barrier was real despite English-speaking sales.

**Eastern European certified tier:**

- **BioBuilds (Romania):** This was the surprise. Passivhaus certified by PHI Darmstadt, 98% organic materials (hemp insulation, CLT, cork), carbon negative at minus 36 kg CO2/m2. When I sent them my floor plan sketches they came back with structural feedback in 4 days. Their architect did a video call and we went through window placement, south orientation, room zoning. They were the most willing to work with my custom layout. Price for a 95m2 turnkey: significantly under the German quotes. Romania's average construction cost sits at EUR 1,676/m2 vs Germany's EUR 4,800, and it shows in the pricing without cutting corners on certification. Production time: about 21 days in factory. Design freedom: 9/10.

- **Modularia (Romania):** Timber frame, nZEB standard (not full Passivhaus). Good communication, decent flexibility. But no Passivhaus certification and less transparency on material specs. They quoted about 20% less than BioBuilds but the comparison isn't apples-to-apples because the energy standard is different.

**Scandinavian/design tier:**

- **Koto Design (UK/Scandi):** Stunning A-frame and cabin aesthetics. Very strong in the hospitality space. But their residential line has fixed floor plans and the customization is mostly about finishes, not layout. For a family of 4 wanting 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, their models didn't quite fit. Design freedom: 4/10.

- **Ark Shelter (Belgium/Slovakia):** Off-grid capable, beautiful design language. But sized for 1-2 people. Their largest unit at about 45m2 wasn't enough for us. I priced two connected units at roughly EUR 140K before transport and site. No Passivhaus certification. Design freedom: limited by module sizes.

## What actually matters in a modular floor plan (the stuff I got wrong at first)

After talking to all these companies and iterating probably 15 versions of our layout, here's what I ended up learning:

**1. South-facing living space is non-negotiable**

This sounds basic but you'd be amazed how many modular floor plans put the kitchen on the south side and the living area north. In our 95m2 layout, the living and dining area faces south with a 3.2m wide triple-glazed window (Ug 0.5 W/m2K). On sunny January days, passive solar gain raises the indoor temp by 3-4 degrees without any heating. Our December heating bill was EUR 22. The whole month.

If your manufacturer gives you a north-facing living room and says "but the kitchen gets great light," run.

**2. Open plan works differently at 95m2 vs 150m2**

We went full open plan (kitchen, dining, living) and it's wonderful for the kids and for hosting. But at 95m2 total, that open area is about 38m2, and when both kids are loud and I need to take a work call, there's nowhere to go except the bedroom.

My wife and I now wish we'd done a sliding partition between the dining area and the living area. Cost would've been maybe EUR 800. The lesson: open plan in compact homes needs escape hatches. The trend magazines don't show families with toddlers.

**3. Ceiling height matters more than floor area**

Our ceilings are 2.7m. Some manufacturers default to 2.5m. That 20cm makes the space feel 30% bigger, no exaggeration. When I visited homes from two different manufacturers (both ~90m2), the one with 2.7m ceilings felt dramatically more spacious. One factory manager told me the extra height adds about EUR 800-1,200 to the module cost. Worth every cent.

**4. The ventilation tech room eats space you didn't budget for**

Passivhaus requires mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR). Ours is a Zehnder unit recovering 95% of heat. It's the reason our air stays fresh and our CO2 readings stay under 600 ppm without opening windows. But the unit, ducts, and a heat pump together need about 5-6m2 of floor space. In a 95m2 home, that's significant. Plan for it from day one. One manufacturer I talked to didn't even mention it until I asked.

**5. Ground screws changed our site plan completely**

No poured concrete foundation. We used ground screws instead and saved roughly EUR 9,000 compared to a conventional foundation. The structural engineer actually preferred them for our soil type, and it means the home is theoretically relocatable. But the real design benefit: ground screws don't require the excavation and curing time of concrete, so our site prep was done in 3 days instead of 3-4 weeks.

## The honest downsides of our modular build

Because every "I built a house" post should include what sucked:

- **Permits.** Germany. 14 weeks for a building permit. The factory built our home in 21 days. Permitting took almost 4x longer than production. If you're in DACH, start the Bauantrag before you finalize your manufacturer.

- **Transport logistics.** Our modules were oversized for standard road transport. Required a special vehicle, police escort for 12km of the route, and a narrow window for crane delivery. Extra cost: about EUR 4,500 that nobody mentioned in the initial quote. Always ask about Lieferlogistik.

- **Interior acoustics.** Timber walls reflect sound differently than plaster. First two weeks our kids' voices bounced around the open plan like a squash court. We added a wool rug (EUR 350) and two acoustic panels (EUR 180 each) and it's fine now. But nobody warned us.

- **Wood moves.** Small hairline cracks in some CLT panels appeared during our first winter as the indoor humidity settled. Normal. Not structural. But if you expect perfect smooth walls, timber frame with a drywall finish is the safer choice for your nerves.

## What I'd tell another architect designing their own modular home

1. Visit at least 2 factories before signing. The quality difference between manufacturers is visible in how they store materials, how the production line is organized, and how they handle your questions. I visited 3 factories (one in Germany, one in Latvia, one in Romania) and could instantly see which operations ran tight.

2. Don't accept "our standard layout." If a manufacturer won't adjust window positions, room sizes, or orientation based on your site, they're selling a product, not building your home.

3. Get the KfW paperwork sorted before your Bauantrag. In Germany, applying for KfW 297/298 (up to EUR 150K at subsidized rates around 2.3-2.7%) needs to happen before the building contract is signed. Miss this sequence and you lose the funding.

4. Budget 15-20% above the module price for site works, transport, crane, utility connections, and permits. This is where people get sticker shock. My module cost was one thing. All-in was roughly 18% more.

5. The European modular market hit about EUR 34 billion in 2025 and is growing at 6-7% per year. Timber leads with 54% material share. This isn't fringe. Sweden builds 80% of new single-family homes using prefab methods. Germany is at 20% and climbing. The supply chain is mature enough that you have real choices now.

## How's the house after one winter?

Honestly? We love it. The kids run around the open plan. My wife reads by the big south window and has a permanent sunlit nook. Indoor temp hasn't dropped below 20.5C even when it was minus 7 outside. The ventilation keeps humidity at 43-47% without a single humidifier.

The timber walls smell faintly of spruce 5 months in. Research shows wood terpenes actually reduce cortisol levels, and honestly, coming home does feel calmer than any apartment I've lived in. Maybe that's the terpenes, maybe it's just owning our space instead of renting.

The biophilic design angle (exposed wood, big windows, natural light) wasn't something I planned as a "trend." It's just what happens when you build with timber and orient toward the sun. Dezeen calls it "curated calm" and lists it as the 2026 interior trend. I call it common sense.

**TL;DR:** Architect designed his own 95m2 modular Passivhaus near Stuttgart. Talked to 8 European manufacturers across 4 countries. Design flexibility varies wildly, from near-zero customization (some German premium) to fully custom floor plans (some Eastern European certified builders). December heating bill: EUR 22. All-in cost was ~18% above module price after site works, transport, crane, permits. Ceiling height (2.7m vs 2.5m) makes a bigger difference than an extra room. European modular market is EUR 34B+ and growing 6-7%/year. Start your Bauantrag before you finalize your manufacturer.

> Price ranges across the continent are wild. German premium runs EUR 4,500-5,200/m2 turnkey. Baltic shell-only starts around EUR 25K but you'll spend EUR 40-55K finishing to liveable standard. Romanian manufacturers with actual Passivhaus certification come in significantly below German pricing because average construction costs there are EUR 1,676/m2 vs Germany's EUR 4,800/m2.
>
> My biggest advice: visit the factory. Not just a showroom. The factory floor tells you everything about quality, material handling, and production discipline. I visited 3 across different countries and could immediately tell which ones I'd trust with my family's home.
>
> Also, if you're comparing on energy performance, make sure you're comparing like for like. "Energy efficient" is marketing. Passivhaus certification (PHI Darmstadt) is binary pass/fail: max 15 kWh/m2/year heating demand, airtightness tested at 0.6 ACH50 or better. Ask for the certificate, not the brochure.

**Post title:** "How does living in a passive house actually feel?"
**Why comment here:** Direct question about the lived experience of a Passive House, where specific interior design and comfort data adds real value.

**Recommended comment:**
> Living in a certified Passivhaus in Germany since September 2025. The comfort difference versus every apartment I've rented is hard to overstate.
>
> Temperature stability: during a minus 7C week in January, the indoor temp never dropped below 20.5C. The MVHR (Zehnder, 95% heat recovery) plus internal gains from 4 humans, cooking, and a laptop basically kept the place warm with minimal heat pump input. Our December heating bill was EUR 22 for 95m2.
>
> Humidity: 43-47% year-round without any humidifiers or dehumidifiers. Every German apartment I lived in dropped to 28-32% in winter. The difference for skin, sleep, and general comfort is significant, and we haven't had the static electricity issues that plague most German homes in January.
>
> Air quality: CO2 readings consistently under 600 ppm with the MVHR running. In our old apartment it would be 900-1100 ppm by morning with the windows closed.
>
> One thing nobody talks about: the timber interior (we left CLT walls exposed) creates a completely different acoustic and olfactory experience. The wood still smells faintly of spruce after 5 months. Research on wood terpenes suggests they reduce cortisol, and honestly, walking into the house does feel calmer. Could be the terpenes, could be a placebo from spending too much on the home. Either way, it's nice.
>
> The downside nobody warns you about: summer overheating is a real risk if your architect doesn't plan external shading. We have motorized blinds on the south and west windows and they're non-optional for Passivhaus in Central Europe.

**Subreddit:** r/realestateinvesting
**Post title:** "Looking at modular cabins for STR investment"
**Why comment here:** Thread about modular cabin investment where specific data on design, build cost, and energy performance adds genuine value for someone evaluating ROI.

**Recommended comment:**
> A few things to consider from the design side, since that's where most cabin STR projects either succeed or fail on revenue:
>
> Window placement is the single highest-ROI design decision for a cabin listing. One large south-facing window creates your hero photo, your guest experience, and your passive solar gain all at once. A 2.4m wide triple-glazed unit (Ug 0.5 W/m2K or better) costs maybe EUR 800 more than a standard window but can raise interior temps by 3-4C on sunny winter days, keeping heating costs negligible. A friend in Austria runs a 28m2 cabin at EUR 14/month in December heating because of this.
>
> Year-round occupancy is where the math changes. Most cabins in Central Europe operate 6-7 months. If you build to Passivhaus or near-Passivhaus spec (wall U-value 0.14, airtightness under 0.6 ACH50), you eliminate winter guest complaints about cold, which is the #1 review killer. That turns a 6-month cabin into a 12-month asset.
>
> On the build side, European modular cabins range from about EUR 25K (Baltic shell, you finish it yourself) to EUR 5,000/m2 (German premium turnkey). For STR, the sweet spot seems to be EUR 55-80K all-in for a 24-30m2 well-insulated cabin. At EUR 100-120/night with 55% occupancy, payback runs 3-4 years.
>
> One thing: always budget 15-20% above the quoted module price for transport, crane, ground screws/foundation, and utility connections. That's where hidden costs live.
