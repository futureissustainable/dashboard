I'm a building consultant who switched to specifying only natural materials 3 years ago. It completely changed how our projects look AND how clients feel in them.

I work as an independent building performance consultant based in Vienna. Studied in Zurich, grew up in Upper Austria. Most of my projects are single-family homes and small multi-family buildings across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but in the last two years I've been doing more work in Romania and Hungary too (Eastern European clients building vacation homes, mostly, plus a few local families).

Three years ago I made a decision that my colleagues thought was reckless: I stopped specifying any synthetic insulation, conventional paints, or composite boards with formaldehyde-based adhesives. Everything had to be natural or at least genuinely low-emission. I want to share what changed, because the effects went way beyond just "healthier air."

## What actually counts as "natural materials" in a wall build-up?

For context, here's a typical wall assembly I specify now:

- CLT structural panels (spruce, PEFC certified)
- Wood fiber or hemp batt insulation (lambda 0.038-0.042 W/mK)
- Clay plaster interior finish (no paint on most surfaces)
- Lime render or timber cladding exterior
- Cork or solid wood flooring

Compared to a standard German/Austrian build which usually goes: concrete or brick, mineral wool or EPS insulation, plasterboard, synthetic paint, and laminate or vinyl flooring.

## The air quality difference is wild

I started doing pre- and post-occupancy IAQ testing on my projects about two years ago. The numbers are honestly kind of dramatic.

**TVOC readings (total volatile organic compounds) across 14 projects:**

- Conventional builds (5 projects, Germany/Austria): average 380 µg/m3 at 4 weeks post-completion, dropping to ~180 µg/m3 after 6 months
- Mixed natural/conventional (4 projects): average 160 µg/m3 at 4 weeks, ~90 µg/m3 at 6 months
- Full natural spec (5 projects): average 45 µg/m3 at 4 weeks, 28 µg/m3 at 6 months

The WHO guideline for TVOC is 300 µg/m3. Most new conventional homes I tested blew past that in the first few months. The natural ones never got close. And look, I know correlation isn't causation, there's selection bias here because clients who pick natural materials also tend to buy less off-gassing furniture. But still. 45 vs 380. That's not a marginal difference.

Formaldehyde specifically: in the conventional builds I measured 35-65 µg/m3 (EU recommended limit is 100 µg/m3, but Germany's Umweltbundesamt suggests under 60 for "hygienically safe"). The natural ones? Between 8 and 15 µg/m3 across the board.

## How it changes design

This is what surprised me most. When you commit to natural materials, the design language changes whether you plan for it or not.

**Clay plaster has texture.** You don't hide it behind flat white paint. It has slight variations in color, catches light differently across a wall. Clients who come from the "everything must be clean white minimalist" school freak out at first. Then 6 months later they tell me it's their favorite thing about the house.

**Exposed timber becomes the aesthetic.** Instead of covering CLT with plasterboard (which, why?), you leave it visible. The grain, the knots, the slight color variations. It's basically free interior design. I've had clients cancel orders for expensive wall art because the wood itself is interesting enough.

**The smell.** I know this sounds fluffy but it's real. Spruce and larch CLT off-gasses terpenes (which are actually beneficial, there's research showing they reduce cortisol). Clients consistently report their homes "smell like a cabin" for the first year. Try getting that from a drywall-and-paint box.

**Humidity regulation is insane.** Clay plaster and timber walls buffer humidity naturally. In my Austrian projects I'm seeing stable 42-50% relative humidity year-round without humidifiers or dehumidifiers. Conventional builds in DACH typically drop to 25-35% in winter (hello, dry skin and static electricity) and spike to 65-70% in summer without active management.

## The cost question (because someone will ask)

Honestly, natural materials are more expensive upfront. For German projects, I'm seeing about EUR 4,800-5,200/m2 all-in for a full natural-material home built to near-Passivhaus spec (vs maybe EUR 4,200-4,500 for conventional to the same energy standard). That's roughly a 10-15% premium.

But here's what I've been telling clients: factor in no repainting needed for 15+ years (clay plaster just needs a wipe), lower maintenance on insulation (wood fiber doesn't settle like cellulose), and the resale factor. I can't prove this with data yet but every German realtor I talk to says natural/timber homes are commanding higher prices per m2 than conventional builds, especially in the Fertighaus market.

In Romania, where I've been working with a few smaller manufacturers, the math is completely different. Construction costs are more like EUR 1,500-2,000/m2 for a well-built timber frame with natural materials. Some Romanian manufacturers are now doing certified Passivhaus modules with hemp insulation and CLT for prices that would make a German Bauherr weep. One project I consulted on last year was 120m2, full hemp + CLT + triple glazing, came in at EUR 195,000 all-in including foundation and site works.

## What I'd do differently

I'm not going to pretend everything is perfect.

- **Clay plaster in bathrooms is tricky.** You need to seal it properly or use tadelakt technique. Had one client get micro-cracking around the shower area. Fixable but annoying.
- **Some natural insulations are hard to source in certain regions.** Hemp batts are easily available in Germany and Austria, much harder to get in Romania (though this is changing fast). Wood fiber is the safer bet for CEE projects.
- **Acoustic performance requires planning.** Timber buildings can be echoey. We learned to specify acoustic clay plaster (heavier mix) and specific floor build-ups to address this. Mass timber alone won't solve it.
- **Fire regulations in Germany are still tricky for exposed timber interiors.** You can do it, but depending on your Gebäudeklasse you might need fire-rated treatment on certain surfaces. Austria is actually more permissive here, and Romania barely regulates it at this point.

## Is it worth it?

For me personally, after 14 projects with this approach: yes, no question. But I also think the "conventional materials are fine" camp has a point. Modern paints and insulations are much better than they were 20 years ago. Nobody's dying from living in a standard German Fertighaus with mineral wool and plasterboard.

The question is whether you want "fine" or whether you want something that actually contributes to how you feel in your space. That's a lifestyle choice, not a technical one. And I genuinely didn't expect the design benefits to be as strong as the health ones.

**TL;DR:** Switched all my building projects to natural materials (CLT, hemp/wood fiber insulation, clay plaster, cork floors) 3 years ago. Measured TVOC levels across 14 projects: natural material homes average 45 µg/m3 vs 380 µg/m3 for conventional builds. Cost premium is about 10-15% in DACH (around EUR 5,000/m2 vs 4,300/m2), but dramatically cheaper in Romania (EUR 1,500-2,000/m2). Humidity stays at 42-50% year-round without mechanical help. The design side benefit was unexpected: exposed timber and clay plaster created spaces that clients love without needing much decorating.

**Post title:** "What insulation should I use for a healthy home?"
**Why comment here:** This is a frequently asked question in r/greenbuilding where detailed material comparisons with real-world data add huge value.

**Recommended comment:**
> I've tested IAQ in about a dozen residential projects over the past couple years. The short answer: wood fiber batts and hemp batts are the two best performers for indoor air quality, with measured TVOC readings consistently under 50 µg/m3 at 4 weeks post-completion. Mineral wool is also fine from a health standpoint (very low off-gassing), but the manufacturing carbon footprint is significantly higher.
>
> Some things worth knowing:
> - Hemp batts have a lambda of around 0.038-0.040 W/mK, pretty comparable to mineral wool. R-3.7 per inch roughly. They also compress without losing R-value, which is handy for irregular stud spacing.
> - Wood fiber (like TimberHP in the US, or Steico/Gutex in Europe) is great for exterior sheathing boards too, not just cavity fill. Lambda around 0.038-0.042 depending on density.
> - The real off-gassing culprit in most homes isn't insulation, it's adhesives, paints, and composite boards. If you're using hemp insulation but then putting formaldehyde-laden OSB everywhere and painting with conventional paint, you're missing the forest for the trees.
> - Budget-wise: hemp batts run about $2.25-2.50/sqft in the US for R-23ish. Wood fiber is similar. That's roughly 2x fiberglass. But if IAQ is your priority, it's worth it.
>
> One more thing: make sure whatever you pick has a Class A or Class B fire rating for your application. Some natural insulations only hit Class C without treatment. Check with your local code official.

**Subreddit:** r/PassiveHouse
**Post title:** "How does living in a passive house actually feel?"
**Why comment here:** Experience-based questions about lived comfort in Passive Houses benefit from concrete data points on humidity, temperature stability, and air quality.

**Recommended comment:**
> Lived in a certified Passivhaus in Austria for going on 3 years now. The biggest thing people don't expect: the humidity stability. Our place sits between 43-49% relative humidity year-round. My previous apartment (conventional 1980s build in Vienna) would drop to 28% in January and spike to 65% in August.
>
> Temperature-wise, we had a week last winter where it hit minus 11C outside. Indoor temp never went below 20.2C without actively turning on our heat pump. The MVHR (mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, ~93% efficiency on ours) plus internal gains from two humans, cooking, and a laptop basically kept the place warm. Our heating bill for all of 2025 was EUR 274. Total. For a 95m2 home.
>
> The thing I'd warn people about: summer overheating is real if your architect doesn't plan for it. We have external venetian blinds on the south and west windows and they're essential. Without them, indoor temps were hitting 27-28C on sunny June days even with the bypass on the MVHR. With the blinds down, we stay under 25C consistently. Budget for external shading if you're doing PH in central Europe, it's not optional.
>
> Air quality from the MVHR is great but you do need to change the filters every 6-12 months (costs about EUR 40-60 per set) and get the system balanced every 2-3 years. Small price for never having stuffy air.

### Comment 3
**Target post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainability/comments/1i2k8vp/what_is_the_most_impactful_thing_you_can_do_to/
**Subreddit:** r/sustainability
**Post title:** "What is the most impactful thing you can do to reduce the carbon footprint of a new home?"
**Why comment here:** Carbon footprint discussions in r/sustainability often overlook embodied carbon in building materials, where a data-heavy comment can shift the conversation.

**Recommended comment:**
> Most people focus on operational carbon (heating, cooling, electricity), but embodied carbon in your building materials is often 30-50% of a home's lifetime emissions, and that number is growing as energy grids get cleaner.
>
> Some numbers to put it in perspective:
> - Standard concrete + steel construction: roughly 400-500 kg CO2/m2 of embodied carbon
> - Timber frame with conventional insulation: around 150-200 kg CO2/m2
> - Full CLT (cross-laminated timber) with natural insulation (hemp, wood fiber): can go carbon negative, some certified builds report minus 30 to minus 40 kg CO2/m2 because the timber stores more carbon than the construction process emits
>
> The single biggest lever is choosing timber over concrete for structure. Mass timber (CLT, glulam) stores about 1 tonne of CO2 per cubic meter of wood. A typical 100m2 timber home uses roughly 20-25m3 of structural timber, so that's 20-25 tonnes of CO2 locked up in the building for its lifespan.
>
> Second biggest lever: insulation choice. EPS and XPS have massive embodied carbon (and the blowing agents in XPS are potent greenhouse gases). Switching to wood fiber or hemp insulation can flip that from a carbon source to a carbon sink.
>
> But honestly, the most impactful single thing? Build smaller. A 90m2 well-designed home has less total carbon impact than a 200m2 timber palace, no matter how green the materials are. Square meters are the multiplier on everything.
