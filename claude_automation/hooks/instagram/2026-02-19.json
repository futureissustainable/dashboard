      "angle": "Frame the lifetime heating cost as a stolen life. The caption shows what €120,000 buys when it's not burning in a boiler: holidays, education, retirement years back. The home isn't the product. The freed-up life is.",
      "psychological_lever": "lifetime cost",
      "target_audience": "DACH families aged 30-45 currently planning or budgeting a new build, obsessively comparing long-term costs",
      "differentiation": "Uses a verified 20-year cumulative number (€120,000 from co2online data) instead of the monthly/annual heating comparisons used in every recent post. The scale of the number creates visceral loss aversion. No other hook uses lifetime framing.",

Or: a pile of €120,000 in cash next to a traditional radiator, contrasted with a BIOBUILDS family on vacation. 4:5 vertical.",

      "angle": "Confront the invisible threat in every conventional home. Caption pivots immediately to the solution: 98% organic materials, zero formaldehyde, medical-grade ventilation. Not shaming the reader, showing them a fact they haven't considered. Alin's origin story (son's asthma diagnosis) is the proof, not the pitch.",
      "psychological_lever": "parental fear",
      "target_audience": "Parents of young children (0-10) across all markets, especially those who already research organic food and clean products but haven't thought about their walls",

Slide 2-3: Text cards with the VOC/formaldehyde data in clean typography. Slide 4: The BIOBUILDS ventilation system detail. Slide 5: Same child playing on the wood floor. The contrast is invisible danger vs visible safety.",

      "angle": "Position BIOBUILDS as the exit from a broken system. While traditional construction is gridlocked by permits, delays, and cost overruns, factory-built Passivhaus homes ship in 21 days. The hook is a current headline number that Romanian IT professionals will instantly recognize from their own house-hunting frustration.",

      "angle": "Reframe the home as the smartest financial move, not just a lifestyle upgrade. While traditional homes depreciate and face tightening EU energy regulations (zero-emission building mandate by 2030), a Passivhaus-certified modular home appreciates. The reader realizes this isn't a cost, it's an investment that pays back from day one.",

      "differentiation": "Only hook that frames the home as a financial asset rather than a lifestyle or health product. Combines two data points (resale premium + build speed) that together create a unique value proposition no competitor can match. Appeals to the logical brain, not the emotional one.",

The aspirational visual does the emotional work while the caption does the financial work. A couple on the deck, wine glasses, the good life that also happens to be a great investment. 4:5 vertical.",

The caption paints the sensory experience of a BIOBUILDS living room: no traffic hum, no boiler clicking, no neighbor's TV. Just the sound of your own life. Make the reader feel the acoustic gap between their current home and this one.",

Through the window: suburban street, cars, neighbors. But inside: stillness. The visual contrast is activity outside, absolute calm inside. Phone-quality feel. 4:5 vertical.",
