      "hook_text": "She walked in and cried. The house was 21 days old.",
      "angle": "Emotional first-impression moment. Caption tells the micro-story of a real homeowner walking into their completed BIOBUILDS home for the first time. Floor-to-ceiling glass, warm wood, filtered air she could feel immediately. The contrast isn't technical, it's the gap between what she expected from 'modular' and what she got. The tears aren't sadness. They're the shock of getting something better than the dream. Make every reader want that moment for themselves.",
      "psychological_lever": "social comparison",
      "target_audience": "Women 28-42 across DACH and Romania who are the emotional decision-makers in the couple, researching homes together with their partner",
      "differentiation": "Only hook that uses a human emotional reaction as the entry point. No numbers, no specs, no contrast statement. Pure story-driven desire creation. The tears create curiosity and the '21 days old' creates the cognitive gap. Completely different tone from data-driven hooks.",
      "platform_meta": {
        "format": "carousel",
        "creative_suggestion": "Slide 1: A woman standing in a bright BIOBUILDS living room, hand over mouth, emotional moment. Floor-to-ceiling glass, winter landscape outside, warm wood everywhere. Shot from behind or side, intimate. Slide 2-4: What she sees: the light pouring through triple-glazed windows, the wood grain ceiling, the open kitchen. Slide 5: The couple together on the deck, first evening. Golden hour. 4:5 vertical.",

      "hook_text": "By 2030, your home must hit zero emissions. Ours already does.",
      "angle": "Position BIOBUILDS as future-proof while everyone else scrambles. The EU Zero Emission Building Directive mandates all new buildings meet ZEB standards by January 2030. That's less than 4 years away. Anyone building traditionally today is building a home that will need expensive retrofitting. BIOBUILDS Passivhaus certification already exceeds the 2030 requirement. The reader realizes: buying now isn't early adoption, it's the only smart move. Creates urgency without fear.",
      "psychological_lever": "regulation/compliance",
      "target_audience": "DACH engineers and analytical buyers (35-50) who follow EU policy, read building regulations, and make decisions based on long-term risk assessment",
      "differentiation": "Only hook using a regulatory deadline as urgency mechanism. No emotional story, no lifestyle imagery. Pure logic-brain appeal with a specific year (2030) that creates a ticking clock. The smugness of 'ours already does' is confidence, not arrogance. Completely different register from every other hook.",

        "creative_suggestion": "BIOBUILDS home exterior, modern and striking, at dusk. Clean, minimal composition. The house looks like it belongs in 2030 already. No text overlay needed. The architecture speaks. Surrounding context: a traditional neighborhood visible in soft background, subtly dating itself. 4:5 vertical.",

      "angle": "Direct confrontation between the old system and the new one, told through a real scenario every home-builder recognizes. The caption briefly paints the couple's journey: quotes from 3 architects, timelines of 12-24 months, budget estimates that kept climbing. Then the BIOBUILDS alternative: factory-built in 21 days, fixed price, Passivhaus certified. Same land, same dream, fraction of the wait. Make the traditional path look absurd by comparison without attacking it directly.",
      "psychological_lever": "time value",
      "target_audience": "Romanian IT couples (30-40) and DACH young families actively in the quoting phase with architects, already frustrated by timelines and cost uncertainty",
      "differentiation": "Only hook that stages a direct head-to-head with the traditional process. Uses a specific, relatable scenario (architect consultation) rather than abstract contrasts. The competitive framing creates an 'aha' moment. Different from heating-cost or lifestyle hooks because it targets the decision-making PROCESS, not the end result.",

        "creative_suggestion": "A completed BIOBUILDS home on a beautiful plot, family already living in it. Through the window: warm light, dinner being prepared. The plot itself tells the story. Trees, hillside, the kind of land someone spent months finding. The home arrived in 3 weeks. The land waited longer for the permits than for the house. 4:5 vertical, golden hour.",

      "angle": "A visceral health contrast that makes the reader's current home feel like a liability. Not shaming. Informing. The 300+ VOCs from conventional building materials (paint, adhesives, particle board) is a documented fact most people have never heard. The oxygen line refers to the 98% organic timber structure that stores carbon and the medical-grade ventilation that delivers filtered fresh air. Connect it to why sleep, focus, and mood are different in a BIOBUILDS home. Make the reader physically uncomfortable about their current walls.",
      "psychological_lever": "health/indoor environment",
      "target_audience": "Health-conscious parents and wellness-oriented professionals across all markets who already buy organic food and filter their water but haven't considered their building materials",
      "differentiation": "Only hook that uses a specific, surprising health statistic (300+ chemicals) as the entry point. While parental fear was used yesterday, this hook targets a broader health-conscious audience and leads with material science, not children. The 'release oxygen' contrast is poetic but factually grounded. Different tone: informational shock, not emotional story.",

Slide 3: The BIOBUILDS ventilation detail, subtle. Slide 4: Family in the living room, barefoot on wood floor, morning light. Slide 5: Material close-up: timber cross-section showing the organic structure. The carousel educates while creating desire. 4:5 vertical.",

      "angle": "The absurd-sounding logistics become the proof of quality. A home precise enough to survive a 1,567km journey across Europe and arrive move-in ready in Germany is a home built with insane precision. The caption reveals what happened next: the German family moved in the same week. Their neighbors, still in month 14 of their traditional build, came over to look. The Romania-to-DACH bridge is the brand story itself. Made in Europe's smartest factory, delivered to Europe's strictest market.",
      "psychological_lever": "trust/legitimacy",
      "target_audience": "DACH buyers who are skeptical about Romanian manufacturing quality, and Romanian buyers who feel pride that world-class products come from their country",
      "differentiation": "Only hook that uses the cross-border delivery as a trust-building device. The specific distance (1,567km) makes it feel real and documented. Addresses the elephant in the room for DACH buyers (Romanian-made?) by turning it into a strength. Different from every other hook: it's a logistics story that becomes a quality proof.",

Music: something triumphant but understated. The journey IS the content. 9:16 vertical.",
