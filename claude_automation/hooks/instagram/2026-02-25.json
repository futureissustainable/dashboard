      "angle": "Romania's government ends residential gas subsidies in March 2026. Conventional heating costs are projected to jump 50-100% overnight. Romanian families who heat with gas (the majority) will feel it immediately. The caption positions BIOBUILDS as the only way to sidestep this entirely: 15 kWh/m²/year means you barely use gas at all. While everyone else braces for the price shock, Passivhaus homeowners won't notice. The timing is perfect: this is breaking news that every Romanian IT professional is already talking about. Make it feel like insider knowledge, not a sales pitch. End with the contrast: your neighbor's March bill vs yours.",

The 336mm walls, triple-glazed windows, and 95% heat recovery ventilation hold interior temperature at 22-24 degrees using body heat, appliances, and passive solar gain alone. The caption doesn't explain the physics. It paints the scene: frozen trees through the panoramic glass, bare feet on warm oak, silence. The reader is currently cold.

Conventional walls are plasterboard, paint, chemical adhesive. BIOBUILDS walls are solid spruce timber, wood-fiber insulation, natural finishes. The smell of a new BIOBUILDS home is forest, not formaldehyde. The caption invites the reader into a physical moment: running their hand along the wall, feeling the grain, breathing in wood instead of paint fumes. No kWh, no euros, no certifications. Just the raw material experience that makes people fall in love with these homes on their first visit. This is the lever that converts skeptics in person. Now bring it to Instagram.",

For BIOBUILDS homeowners, the Nebenkosten are so low they're practically irrelevant: under €100/year heating, minimal water heating, no boiler maintenance. The word 'rounding error' is the punchline that makes it shareable. The reader opens their Abrechnung, sees the number, then sees this post and feels the gap.

The majority occurred indoors, in homes without adequate thermal protection. Conventional buildings with poor insulation trap heat in summer just as they leak it in winter. The same Passivhaus engineering that keeps a BIOBUILDS home warm in February keeps it cool in July: 336mm insulated walls, triple-glazed windows with smart exterior blinds, heat recovery ventilation. 24 degrees year-round. No AC needed. The caption doesn't sell comfort. It reframes energy performance as survival infrastructure. Make the reader reconsider what 'well-insulated' actually protects against. This is a February post about summer because the decision to build happens now, not in July.",

The reversal of expectations (heat deaths in a February post) creates cognitive disruption. While a similar angle appeared in 2/24 batch, that hook led with '2,300 Europeans died in 10 days.' This one uses the full summer 2025 statistic (16,500) which is larger and more current. The words 'all of them indoors' is the scroll-stopping twist.",
