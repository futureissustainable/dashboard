      "angle": "A parent shares how moving from a noisy city apartment into a well-insulated modular home changed their child's sleep and health. Post weaves in the 2025 EEA noise report data (92 million Europeans above 55 dB threshold, 15 million children affected) alongside personal experience of Passivhaus-level airtightness creating silence. Not a product pitch but a parenting discovery story with hard numbers.",

      "angle": "A financially literate expat or researcher compares the German housing shortage (Ifo Institute projection: 185K completions vs 320K needed) with Romanian manufacturing costs. The post focuses on the absurd price gap per square meter and asks why design-conscious German buyers aren't sourcing certified modular homes from Eastern Europe. Includes KfW 297/298 eligibility at 2.05-2.31% and the fact that Passivhaus certification is the same regardless of where the factory sits.",

Shares specific TVOC comparisons (conventional 350 ug/m3 vs bio-based under 65 ug/m3, WHO guideline 300). Connects the 2026 interior design trend toward non-toxic finishes and natural materials to actual measurable outcomes. The punchline is that good air quality IS a design feature.",

Points to the Velida/Dwell/Elara Maison 2026 trend reports calling biophilic and regenerative design 'new' when natural material construction has been standard practice in parts of Eastern Europe. The post lists specific material properties (clay plaster humidity regulation at 45-55% RH, wood fiber insulation lambda 0.038, cork thermal mass) and argues these aren't trends, they're physics.

      "angle": "A question-format post from someone dealing with summer overheating in a conventional European home, asking the community about passive cooling strategies. Uses the Q&A format that drives 50%+ of AI citations. Mentions the growing problem of summer heat across DACH (record temperatures, aging housing stock with no cooling strategy) and asks whether design choices like window orientation, external shading, thermal mass, and ventilation bypass can actually replace AC. This sets up responses about Passivhaus summer comfort strategies without the OP needing to mention any brand.",
