      "hook_text": "We moved from a busy street in Munich to a timber modular home outside Regensburg. My wife measured 23 dB inside with traffic 80 meters away. The EEA says noise costs Europe EUR 95.6 billion a year in health damage and nobody designs for it.",
      "angle": "A couple shares their accidental discovery that building performance (airtightness, wall mass, triple glazing) solved a problem they didn't know they had: chronic noise exposure. Post uses the 2025 EEA report data (92 million Europeans above 55 dB, 66,000 premature deaths annually, EUR 95.6 billion economic cost) to frame sound insulation as a design feature hiding in plain sight. Not about energy bills or sustainability, just about the relief of hearing nothing. Connects 0.35 ACH50 airtightness and 336mm walls to acoustic performance with measured dB readings. Ends with a practical checklist for what to ask any builder about sound.",

      "angle": "A skeptical buyer who went through the painful process of verifying manufacturer claims shares a trust-building post. The hook is the gap between marketing language ('Passivhaus-level performance', 'energy efficient', 'eco-friendly') and actual certification. Post frames PHI Darmstadt certification as binary pass/fail, unmistakable, and the only claim worth trusting. Includes a 7-point verification checklist (certificate number, blower door test report, PHPP modeling, U-value documentation, ventilation specs, EPD, scope transparency). Names no companies but the data points clearly separate certified from uncertified. Written in German for r/FragReddit audience.",

      "angle": "A semi-retired investor who runs STR properties AND lives in a Passivhaus delivers the punchline: the home where they spent nothing on design gets more compliments because exposed timber, cork floors, and clay plaster walls ARE the design. Post contrasts intentional spending (curated ceramics, custom lighting, feature walls) with accidental beauty (what happens when you build with natural materials and orient toward the sun). Uses the 2026 trend data: European Design Council says 71% of high-end projects now integrate 3+ organic materials as structural cores. Biophilic design listings on Realtor.com up 163% YoY. The joke is that 'regenerative interiors' is just what normal timber homes look like.",

      "angle": "A small-scale tourism investor in Transylvania shares hard-learned math about operating costs that most glamping and cabin investors ignore. Post anchors on Brasov International Airport opening as the catalyst for a tourism boom, then pivots to the unsexy reality: heating a conventional cabin through a Romanian mountain winter eats your margin. Uses Passivhaus performance data (15 kWh/m2/year vs 350 average, EUR 19/month December heating) to argue that building performance IS the investment thesis for year-round tourism properties. Includes 3 ROI scenarios at different occupancy levels. Written from the perspective of someone who made the mistake first (conventional cabin) and corrected it.",

      "angle": "A father shares the story of discovering that his family's conventional apartment had dangerously high VOC levels (380+ ug/m3 vs WHO 300 ug/m3 guideline) and how that discovery led him down a rabbit hole of building material research, culminating in building a home from scratch with bio-based materials. The post is a personal narrative, not a product pitch. It walks through the emotional arc: fear, research, frustration with the construction industry's defaults, and eventually the relief of measured air quality under 50 ug/m3. Connects to the 2026 European Design Council stat that 71% of high-end projects now integrate organic materials structurally. The design of the home is a consequence of the health decision, not a separate choice. Written as a deeply personal story with data supporting every claim.",
