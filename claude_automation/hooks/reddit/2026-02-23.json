      "angle": "A German homeowner shares their obsessive energy tracking data from 14 months in a high-performance home, contrasting it with the Fraunhofer IFAM projection that gas grid costs alone could reach EUR 4,300/year by 2045. The post walks through monthly kWh readings, compares them to co2online's national averages (EUR 1,180/year gas heating for a 70m2 apartment), and frames the decision to build to Passivhaus standard as a hedge against a cost curve that only goes up. Includes the CO2online stat: an unrenovated gas-heated single-family home will cost EUR 120,000 in heating over 20 years. No brand mentions, just data.",

      "angle": "A building professional or informed buyer breaks down the revised EPBD (EU/2024/1275), which must be transposed into national law by May 2026 and mandates zero-emission new buildings by 2030. The post explains what 'zero-emission' actually means in practice (very high energy performance, zero fossil fuel emissions, near-zero operational GHG), compares it to current building codes, and notes that Passivhaus-certified buildings already exceed these requirements. Includes the stat that 16% of worst-performing non-residential buildings must be renovated by 2030 and residential energy use must drop 16% by 2030. The hook is regulatory urgency: if you're building a house that doesn't meet these standards, you're building a liability.",

      "angle": "A homeowner tells the story of a neighborhood split during Europe's energy crisis. Same street, same winter, wildly different outcomes. The post doesn't start with specs or certifications but with the social awkwardness of watching your neighbors suffer while you're fine, and feeling weird about mentioning your heating bill at a block party. Then it gets into why: wall U-value of 0.14 W/m2K, triple glazing at Ug 0.5, airtightness at 0.35 ACH50, heat recovery ventilation at 95% efficiency. The contrast makes the technical data emotionally accessible. Includes the Euronews stat that German heating bills have tripled since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the co2online finding that heating costs rose 82% cumulatively since 2021.",

      "angle": "A small-scale STR operator in Romania's Transylvania region shares a direct operational cost comparison between conventional and high-performance cabins. The hook is that most glamping and cabin investors model revenue but ignore that heating costs in a mountain winter can eat 40-60% of off-season margin. Post includes: Romania's gas subsidies ending March 2026 (pushing conventional heating costs higher), the math on winter occupancy viability (at EUR 64 ADR and 52% occupancy, a EUR 190/month heating cost turns December-February into net losses for conventional cabins), and why airtightness and heat recovery make year-round operation possible. Ends with a simple spreadsheet showing break-even occupancy for each cabin type.",

      "angle": "A research-oriented post that leads with the University of Bath study of 97 UK Passivhaus dwellings, the largest systematic evaluation of the standard in occupied buildings. The hook is the contrast between Passivhaus (which performs as designed, even slightly better) and conventional construction (which routinely uses up to 250% more energy than predicted). The 'why doesn't anyone talk about this' framing invites community discussion. Post connects this to the EU average of 350 kWh/m2/year, positions the Passivhaus standard as the only building method with statistically verified real-world performance, and asks why building codes still allow such massive performance gaps.
