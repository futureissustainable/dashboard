      "angle": "Personal founder story about choosing the tiny module over the family home. The post reveals that Alin and his wife sleep in a 19m² Wanderlust instead of RIA (their 200m² Passivhaus). Explores why less space with better air, silence, and materials feels like more. Ties to the 48m² Wanderlust being BioBuilds' fastest-growing product. Ends with the question of what people actually use in their homes.",
      "psychological_lever": "social comparison",
      "target_audience": "Romanian IT professionals (30-45) and DACH couples planning their first build, both conditioned to maximize square meters",
      "differentiation": "This is a personal vulnerability/confession hook. No data in the hook itself. The surprise is that the founder of a home company prefers the smallest product. It inverts the industry norm (bigger = better) through a personal, relatable marital anecdote rather than specs or stats.",

      "angle": "A cost confrontation post built around the absurd price gap between DACH and Romania for an identical certified product. Uses real 2026 Munich new-build pricing (EUR 5,000+/m²) against BioBuilds Romania pricing. The post explores WHY the gap exists (labor, land, overheads) and what it means for German families willing to think differently. Ends with the question: if the certificate is identical, what exactly are you paying EUR 3,324 extra per square meter for?",

      "angle": "A parental fear hook told through a child's innocent observation. The post unpacks what 'different smell' actually means in building science: formaldehyde from MDF, VOCs from paint, off-gassing from foam insulation. Connects to Alin's origin story (son's asthma) without retelling it. Cites the WHO stat on indoor air being 2-5x more polluted than outdoor. Contrasts with the 98% organic interior of a BioBuilds home. The child's question becomes the post's thesis: kids notice what adults have normalized.",

      "differentiation": "Only hook using a child's perspective. Emotional entry point, not data. The hook creates curiosity (what did the house smell like? why couldn't he answer?) rather than stating a fact. Completely different tone from the cost/comparison hooks. Ties back to BioBuilds origin story organically.",

The post uses this as a lens on how the entire financial system is built around the assumption that construction takes 18 months. Ties to the broader truth: modular Passivhaus breaks not just construction norms but financing norms, insurance models, and appraisal frameworks. Includes the punchline data: the house was already occupied, certified, and saving energy while the bank was still on page 2 of its review.",

      "angle": "A Romania/Eastern Europe angle that uses DACH as the benchmark to reframe prefab perception. The post shows that Germany's most engineering-proud state has already bet on factory-built homes at massive scale (43.5% market share per Destatis 2024 data). Romania, where BioBuilds manufactures, is still stuck at sub-3% prefab adoption despite producing the homes that Germans buy. The irony: Romania builds the future for Germany but won't build it for itself. Explores why (cultural bias toward brick/concrete, distrust of 'lightweight' construction, lack of awareness of Passivhaus). Ends by asking Romanian readers: if German engineers trust factory-built homes, what are you waiting for?",

      "differentiation": "Only hook with a Romania-specific angle and Eastern Europe framing. Uses a percentage stat rather than EUR. The psychological lever (trust/legitimacy via German adoption) is unique. The tone is neither philosophical nor personal but rather journalistic and data-driven, creating a different texture."
